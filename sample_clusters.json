The mission, dubbed Starlink 6-81, saw 29 Starlink V2 Mini satellites sent to low Earth orbit. The spacecraft were deployed all at once a little more than an hour after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 40 happened at 8:31:10 p.m. EST (0131:10 UTC). The rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving Florida\u2019s Space Coast.

We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features.

Our model can be used to denoise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars.

We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\\tt{galacticus}} (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ ($m_{\\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.2} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 < m/M_{\\odot}<10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \\%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in tension with recent N-body simulations ($0.3 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are the strongest limits on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.",

The analysis of the mean spectra reveals that the Balmer decrement shows no correlation with AGN luminosity, while it is inversely correlated with the Eddington ratio. However, the temporal variation of the Balmer decrement in individual objects exhibits an even stronger anti-correlation with AGN luminosity, suggesting that the change in AGN luminosity plays a dominant role in determining the Balmer decrement. By comparing the temporal evolution of the Balmer decrement with the continuum color, we find that reddening due to the AGN itself may not be the primary factor. Instead, radiative transfer effects and excitation mechanisms, which deviate from the Case B recombination, appear to be critical for the variation of the Balmer decrement. These results provide useful insights into the underlying physics of changing-look AGNs and high-$z$ AGNs, such as the ``little red dots'', which exhibit extreme values of the Balmer decrement that can be misinterpreted as evidence for dust.",

      "text": "Detection of unexpected leading delays in broad H{\\beta} line reverberations in the quasar PHL 1092 \n arXiv:2511.07716v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Delayed reverberations of broad emission lines in response to optical continuum variations have been widely observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). They serve as a powerful tool for probing inner structures of AGNs and estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The delays exhibit a strong correlation with approximately the square root of the optical luminosity - a relationship known as the \"standard structure\" of AGN broad-line regions (BLRs). Here, we report the discovery of leading delays in H{\\beta} line reverberations (LDRs) in the quasar PHL 1092 preceding variations of the 5100 {\\AA} continuum by 17-57 days, based on our eight-year continuous campaign of reverberation mapping of super Eddington AGNs. The LDRs suggest that the 5100 {\\AA} continuum regions are so extensive that they are larger than the BLRs. This phenomenon not only fundamentally disrupts the well-established BLR size-luminosity relation but also violates the principle of causality. This unprecedented LDRs challenge the conventional methods for estimating SMBH mass as well as the standard model of AGNs. A preferred scenario to explain the LDRs is that the SMBH-disk contains a population of accreting stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) as extra heating sources of the disk.

      "rep_text": "A Timescale-Resolved Analysis of the Breathing Effect in Quasar Broad Line Regions \n arXiv:2511.07547v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The single-epoch virial method is a fundamental tool for estimating supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in large samples of AGNs and has been extensively employed in studies of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time. However, since this method is calibrated using reverberation-mapped AGNs, its validity across the entire AGN population remains uncertain. We aim to examine the breathing effect-the variability of emission line widths with continuum luminosity-beyond reverberation-mapped AGNs, to assess the validity and estimate potential systematic uncertainties of single-epoch virial black hole mass estimates. We construct an unprecedentedly large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of quasars from SDSS DR16, focusing on four key broad emission lines (Ha, Hb, MgII, and CIV). We assess how breathing behavior evolves with the rest-frame time interval between observations. We detect no significant breathing signal in Ha, Hb, or MgII at any observed timescale. In contrast, CIV exhibits a statistically significant anti-breathing trend, most prominent at intermediate timescales. Notably, for Hb, which has shown breathing in previous reverberation-mapped samples, we recover the effect only in the small subset of quasars with clearly detected BLR lags and only during the epochs when such lags are measurable-suggesting that both the lag and breathing signals are intermittent, possibly due to a weak correlation between optical and ionizing continua. These results highlight the complex, variable, and timescale-dependent nature of line profile variability and underscore its implications for single-epoch black hole mass estimates."

      "text": "Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters \n arXiv:2509.05415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called \"hierarchical merger\" channel), most star clusters with masses $\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_\\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\\sim200\\,M_\\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\\,M_\\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\\chi \\gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\\chi \\lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\\sim10\\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.",
