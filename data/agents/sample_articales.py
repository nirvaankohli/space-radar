Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science Visualization Studio shows the merger of two black holes and the waves they create in the process. Two black holes orbit each other, generating space-time ripples called gravitational waves in this animation. As the black holes get closer, the waves increase in until they merge completely. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab How It Works A gravitational wave observatory, like LIGO, is built with two tunnels, each approximately 2.5 miles long, arranged in an “L” shape. At the end of each tunnel, a highly polished 40 kg mirror (about 16 inches across) is mounted; this will reflect the laser beam that is sent from the observatory. A laser beam is sent from the observatory room and split into two, with equal parts traveling down each tunnel, bouncing off the mirrors at the end. When the beams return, they are recombined. If the arm lengths are perfectly equal, the light waves cancel out in just the right way, producing darkness at the detector. But if a gravitational wave passes, it slightly stretches one arm while squeezing the other, so the returning beams no longer cancel perfectly, creating a flicker of light that reveals the wave’s presence. When a gravitational wave passes by Earth, it squeezes and stretches space. LIGO can detect this squeezing and stretching. Each LIGO observatory has two “arms” that are each more than 2 miles (4 kilometers) long. A passing gravitational wave causes the length of the arms to change slightly. The observatory uses lasers, mirrors, and extremely sensitive instruments to detect these tiny changes. NASA The actual detection happens at the point of recombination, when even a minuscule stretching of one arm and squeezing of the other changes how long it takes the laser beams to return. This difference produces a measurable shift in the interference pattern. To be certain that the signal is real and not local noise, both LIGO observatories — one in Washington State (LIGO Hanford) and the other in Louisiana (LIGO Livingston) — must record the same pattern within milliseconds. When they do, it’s confirmation of a gravitational wave rippling through Earth. We don’t feel these waves as they pass through our planet, but we now have a method of detecting them! Get Involved With the help of two additional gravitational-wave observatories, VIRGO and KAGRA , there have been 300 black hole mergers detected in the past decade ; some of which are confirmed, while others await further study. While the average person may not have a laser interferometer lying around in the backyard, you can help with two projects geared toward detecting gravitational waves and the black holes that contribute to them: Black Hole Hunters: Using data from the TESS satellite , you would study graphs of how the brightness of stars changes over time, looking for an effect called gravitational microlensing. This lensing effect can indicate that a massive object has passed in front of a star, such as a black hole. Gravity Spy: You can help LIGO scientists with their gravitational wave research by looking for glitches that may mimic gravitational waves. By sorting out the mimics, we can train algorithms on how to detect the real thing. You can also use gelatin, magnetic marbles, and a small mirror for a more hands-on demonstration on how gravitational waves move through space-time with JPL’s Dropping In With Gravitational Waves activity!",

Credit: NASA/Max van Otterdyk NASA, along with leaders from global space agencies and government representatives worldwide, convened on Monday to further the implementation of the Artemis Accords — practical principles designed to guide the responsible exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The meeting was held during the 76th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) taking place in Sydney. In opening remarks, acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy highlighted the five-year anniversary of the Artemis Accords next month. “When President Trump launched the Artemis Accords in his first term, he made sure American values would lead the way – bringing together a coalition of nations to set the rules of the road in space and ensure exploration remains peaceful. After five years, the coalition is stronger than ever. This is critical as we seek to beat China to the Moon, not just to leave footprints, but this time to stay,” said Duffy. The United States, led by NASA and the U.S. Department of State, signed the accords on Oct. 13, 2020, with seven other founding nations. The accords were created in response to the growing global interest in lunar activities by governments and private companies. They now comprise 56 country signatories — nearly 30% of the world’s countries. The event was co-chaired by NASA, the Australian Space Agency, and the UAE Space Agency. Dozens of nations were represented, creating the foundation for future space exploration for the Golden Age of exploration and innovation. “Australia is a proud founding signatory of the Artemis Accords and is focused on supporting new signatories in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Head of Australian Space Agency Enrico Palermo. “The purpose of the accords is as important — if not more important — as it was when first established. This annual gathering of principals at IAC 2025 is a key opportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to exploring the Moon, Mars and beyond in a peaceful, safe, and sustainable way.” During the meeting, leaders discussed recommendations for non-interference in each other’s space activities including transparency on expected launch dates, general nature of activities, and landing locations. They also discussed orbital debris mitigation and disposal management, interoperability of systems for safer and more efficient operations, and the release of scientific data. In May 2025, the United Arab Emirates hosted an Artemis Accords workshop focused on topics, such as non-interference and space object registration and reporting beyond Earth orbit. “Through our active participation in the Artemis Accords and by organizing specialised workshops, we aim to reinforce the principles of transparency, sustainability, and innovation in space activities. We are committed to strengthening international partnerships and facilitating the exchange of expertise, thereby contributing to the development of a robust global framework for safe and responsible space exploration, while opening new frontiers for scientific research,” said UAE Minister of Sports and Chairman of UAE Space Agency Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi. “This reflects the UAE’s unwavering commitment to enhancing international cooperation in space exploration and promoting the peaceful use of space.” More countries are expected to sign the Artemis Accords in the months and years ahead, as NASA continues its work to establish a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space.

Skywatching Highlights Oct. 6: The October supermoon Oct. 6-10: The Draconid meteor shower Oct. 21: The Orionid meteor shower peaks (full duration Sept. 26 – Nov. 22) Transcript What’s Up for October? A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky. The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because – it’s a supermoon! Illustrated infographic showing the difference (as seen from Earth) between perigee, when a supermoon appears, and apogee, when a micromoon appears. NASA/JPL-Caltech This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with “perigee,” which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptionally close full moon! Which explains its spectacular appearance. And what timing – while the supermoon appears on October 6th, just a couple of days before on October 4th is “International Observe the Moon Night”! It’s an annual, worldwide event when Moon enthusiasts come together to enjoy our natural satellite.You can attend or host a moon-viewing party, or simply observe the Moon from wherever you are. So look up, and celebrate the moon along with people all around the world! The supermoon will light up the sky on October 6th, but if you luck into some dark sky between October 6th and 10th, you might witness the first of two October meteor showers – the Draconids! The Draconid meteor shower comes from debris trailing the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner burning up in Earth’s atmosphere These meteors originate from nearby the head of the constellation Draco the dragon in the northern sky and the shower can produce up to 10 meteors per hour! The Draconids peak around October 8th, but if you don’t see any, you can always blame the bright supermoon and wait a few weeks until the next meteor shower – the Orionids! Sky chart showing the Draconid meteor shower, including the radiant point of the shower and the Draco constellation where the meteors in the shower are often seen and stem from. NASA/JPL-Caltech The Orionid meteor shower, peaking October 21, is set to put on a spectacular show, shooting about 20 meteors per hour across the night sky. This meteor shower happens when Earth travels through the debris trailing behind Halley’s Comet and it burns up in our atmosphere. The full duration of the meteor shower stretches from September 26 to November 22, but your best bet to see meteors is on October 21 before midnight until around 2 am. Sky chart showing the Orionid meteor shower, including the radiant point of the shower and the Orion constellation where the meteors in the shower are often seen and stem from. NASA/JPL-Caltech This is because, not only is this night the shower’s peak, it is also the October new moon, meaning the moon will be between the Earth and the Sun, making it dark and invisible to us. With a moonless sky, you’re much more likely to catch a fireball careening through the night. So find a dark location after the sun has set, look to the southeast sky (if you’re in the northern hemisphere) and the northeast (if you’re in the southern hemisphere) and enjoy! Orionid meteors appear to come from the direction of the Orion constellation but you might catch them all across the sky. Here are the phases of the Moon for October.

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds of years to reach us. But in the daytime, we only see one star: the Sun. It dominates the daytime sky because it is so close – about 93 million miles (or 150 million kilometers) away. That distance is also called one astronomical unit , and its another unit of measurement astronomers use to record distance in space. But even if 1 astronomical unit seems like a long way, it’s still about 270 thousand times closer than Alpha Centauri , the next nearest star system. The Sun isn’t just close – it’s also gigantic! The Sun is large enough to fit more than a million Earths inside it, and has more mass than 330 thousand Earths put together. Its light also provides the energy which allows life as we know it to flourish. For these reasons, the Sun is a powerful presence in our lives. We all have a relationship with the Sun, so knowing about it, and about the benefits and hazards of its presence, is essential. Teaching About the Sun Autumn is when most students in the United States return for a new school year after summer vacation. This back-to-school time offers a wonderful opportunity to reach students fresh off of a few months of fun in the Sun and capture their imaginations with new information about how our native star works and how it impacts their lives. To that end, NASA conducts efforts to educate and inform students and educators about the Sun, its features, and the ways it impacts our lives. NASA’s Heliophysics Education Activation Team (HEAT) teaches people of all ages about the Sun, covering everything from how to safely view an eclipse to how to mitigate the effects of geomagnetic storms. This “Our Dynamic Sun” banner is one of many educational outreach products offered by NASA HEAT. It uses imagery of the Sun at different wavelengths of light to demonstrate the features of our nearest star, and features information about how the Sun interacts with the rest of the Solar System. NASA HEAT This often means tailoring lesson plans for educators. By connecting NASA scientists who study Heliophysics with education specialists who align the material to K-12 content standards, HEAT gets Heliophysics out of the lab and into the classroom. Making Sun science accessible lets learners of all ages and backgrounds get involved in and excited about the discovery, and instills a lifelong thirst for knowledge that builds the next generation of scientists. Since 2007, NASA’s Living With a Star (LWS) program and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research’s Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (CPAESS) have cooperated to offer the Heliophysics Summer School program for doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars. This program aims to foster heliophysics as an integrated science, teaching a new generation of researchers to engage in cross-disciplinary communication while they are still in the early days of their career. One Way to Get Involved As part of its efforts to increase awareness of the scientific and social importance of heliophysics, and to both inspire future scientists and spark breakthroughs in heliophysics as a discipline, the NASA Heliophysics Education Activation Team (NASA HEAT) is working on a slate of educational materials designed to get students involved with real-world mission data. My NASA Data , in collaboration with NASA HEAT, has released a new set of resources for educators centered around space weather. My NASA Data supports the use of authentic NASA data as part of classroom learning materials. These materials include lesson plans, mini-lessons (shorter activities for quick engagement), student-facing web-based interactives, and a longer “story map,” which deepens the investigation of the phenomenon over multiple class periods. These resources are designed to engage learners with data and observations collected during both past and ongoing missions, including the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter , NASA’s Parker Solar Probe and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and more. One example of this is the educational material published to support outreach efforts focusing on the 2023 and 2024 American solar eclipses. These materials allowed learners to collect their own data on cloud and temperature observations during the eclipses with the GLOBE Observer Eclipse tool. This gave them the chance to participate in the scientific process by contributing meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment. New Ways to Engage Groups like HEAT don’t just spark interest in science for the sake of inspiring the next generation of heliophysicists. Just like amateur astronomers can bring in a lot more data than their professional counterparts, citizen scientists can do a lot to support the same institutions that may have inspired them to take up the practice of citizen science. This can mean anything from helping to track sunspots to reporting on the effects of space weather events. 2023 Partial Solar Eclipse Viewing at Camino Real Marketplace with the View the Santa Barbara Astronomical Unit. Events like this, which can take place during major events such as eclipses or during impromptu circumstances, offer an excellent opportunity for the public to get involved in and excited about heliophysics. Photo by Chuck McPartlin These enthusiasts are also adept at sharing knowledge of heliophysics. Even just one person inspired to buy a telescope with the right solar filter (international standard ISO 12312-2), set it up in a park, and teach their neighbors about the Sun can do amazing work, and there are a lot more of them than there are professional scientists. That means these amateur heliophysicists can reach farther than even the best official outreach. Whether they take place in the classroom, at conferences, or in online lectures, the efforts of science communicators are a vital part of the work done at NASA. Just as scientists make new discoveries, these writers, teachers, audio and video producers, and outreach specialists are passionate about making those discoveries accessible to the public. All of this work helps to inspire the scientists of tomorrow, and to instill wonder in the citizen scientists of today. The Sun is a constant and magnificent presence in our lives, and it offers plenty of reasons to be inspired, both now and in the future.

Credit: NASA/Max van Otterdyk At the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) taking place in Sydney this week, representatives from the United States and Australia gathered to sign a framework agreement that strengthens collaboration in aeronautics and space exploration between the two nations. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy and Australian Space Agency Head Enrico Palermo signed the agreement Tuesday on behalf of their countries, respectively. “Australia is an important and longtime space partner, from Apollo to Artemis, and this agreement depends on that partnership,” said Duffy. “International agreements like this one work to leverage our resources and increase our capacities and scientific returns for all, proving critical to NASA’s plans from low Earth orbit to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.” Australian Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Science Tim Ayres said the signing builds on more than half a century of collaboration between the two nations. “Strengthening Australia’s partnership with the U.S. and NASA creates new opportunities for Australian ideas and technologies, improving Australia’s industrial capability, boosting productivity, and building economic resilience,” Ayres said. Known as the “Framework Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Australia on Cooperation in Aeronautics and the Exploration and Use of Airspace and Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes,” it recognizes cooperation that’s mutually beneficial for the U.S. and Australia and establishes the legal framework under which the countries will work together. Potential areas for cooperation include space exploration, space science, Earth science including geodesy, space medicine and life sciences, aeronautics research, and technology. NASA has collaborated with Australia on civil space activities since 1960, when the two countries signed their first cooperative space agreement. The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex played a vital role in supporting NASA’s Apollo Program, most notably during the Apollo 13 mission. Today, the complex is one of three global stations in NASA’s Deep Space Network, supporting both robotic and human spaceflight missions. One of the original signatories to the Artemis Accords, Australia joined the United States under President Donald Trump and six other nations in October 2020, in supporting a basic set of principles for the safe and responsible use of space. Global space leaders from many of the 56 signatory countries met at IAC in Sydney this week to further their implementation. As part of an existing partnership with the Australian Space Agency, Australia is developing a semi-autonomous lunar rover, which will carry a NASA analysis instrument intended to demonstrate technology for scientific and exploration purposes. The rover is scheduled to launch by the end of this decade through NASA’s CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative. NASA’s international partnerships reflect the agency’s commitment to peaceful, collaborative space exploration. Building on a legacy of cooperation, from the space shuttle to the International Space Station and now Artemis, international partnerships support NASA’s plans for lunar exploration under the Artemis campaign and future human exploration of Mars.

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about 5 million years old, or almost 1,000 times younger than the Earth, and about 437 light-years from Earth. Being a giant and still-growing baby planet, WISPIT 2b is interesting to study on its own, but its location in this protoplanetary disk gap is even more fascinating. Protoplanetary disks are made of gas and dust that surround young stars and function as the birthplace for new planets. Within these disks, gaps or clearings in the dust and gas can form, appearing as empty rings. Scientists have long suggested that these growing planets are likely responsible for clearing the material in these gaps, pushing and scattering dusty disk material outwards and greeting the ring gaps in the first place. Our own solar system was once just a protoplanetary disk, and it’s possible that Jupiter and Saturn may have cleared ring gaps like this in that disk  many, many years ago. But despite continued observation of stars with these kinds of disks, there was never any direct evidence of a growing planet found in one of these ring gaps. That is, until now. As reported in this paper , WISPIT 2b was directly observed in one of the ring gaps around its star, WISPIT 2. Another interesting aspect of this discovery is that WISPIT 2b appears to have formed where it was found, it didn’t form elsewhere and move into the gap somehow. This artist’s concept depicts a close-up of the protoplanet WISPIT 2b accreting matter as it orbits around its star, WISPIT 2. NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC) Details: The star WISPIT 2 was first observed using VLT-SPHERE (Very Large Telescope – Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch), a ground-based telescope in northern Chile operated by the European Southern Observatory. In these observations, the rings and gap around this star were first seen. Following these observations of the system, researchers looked at WISPIT 2, and spotted the planet WISPIT 2b for the first time, using the University of Arizona’s MagAO-X extreme adaptive optics system, a high-contrast exoplanet imager at the Magellan 2 (Clay) Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. This technology adds another unique layer to this discovery. The MagAO-X instrument captures direct images, so it didn’t just detect WISPIT 2b, it essentially captured a photograph of the protoplanet. The team used this technology to study the WISPIT 2 system in what is called H-alpha, or Hydrogen-alpha, light. This is a type of visible light that is emitted when hydrogen gas falls from a protoplanetary disk onto young, growing planets. This could look like a ring of super heated plasma circling the planet. This plasma emits the H-alpha light that MagAO-X is specially designed to detect (even if it is a very faint signal compared to the bright star nearby). When looking at the system in H-alpha light, the team spotted a clear dot in one of the dark ring gaps in the disk around WISPIT 2. This dot? The planet WISPIT 2b. In addition to observing the protoplanet’s H-alpha emission using MagAO-X, the team also studied the protoplanet in other wavelengths of infrared light using the LMIRcam detector as part of the The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer instrument on the University of Arizona’s Large Binocular Telescope. Fun Facts: In addition to discovering WISPIT 2b, this team spotted a second dot in one of the other dark ring gaps even closer to the star WISPIT 2. This second dot has been identified as another candidate planet that will likely be investigated in future studies of the system. The Discoverers: WISPIT-2b was discovered by a team led by University of Arizona astronomer Laird Close and Richelle van Capelleveen, an astronomy graduate student at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. This followed the recent discovery of the WISPIT 2 disk and ring system using the VLT, which was led by van Capelleveen. This discovery was detailed in the paper “Wide Separation Planets in Time (WISPIT): Discovery of a Gap Hα Protoplanet WISPIT 2b with MagAO-X,” published August 26, 2025 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. A second paper led by van Capelleveen and the University of Galway published on the same day in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. This research was partially supported by a grant from the NASA eXoplanet Research Program. MagAO-X was developed in part by a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation with support from the Heising-Simons Foundation.",

When a meteoroid shook the edge of Apollinaris Mons on Mars, it triggered streaks that carved a hundred new scratches on the surface. The European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured these dust avalanches on the slopes the night before Christmas in 2023. This image from the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) onboard the European orbiter also shows the faint cluster of impact craters in the discoloured region at the base of the slopes. Additional imagery helped scientists determine that the impact and streak formation occurred between 2013 and 2017. Scientists believe these streaks on Mars form when layers of fine dust suddenly slide off steep terrain. With no evidence of water, they concluded that these features mostly result from dry processes driven by wind and dust activity. A new study published in Nature Communications suggests that this is a rare event; fewer than one in a thousand streaks are caused by rocks smashing into Mars.  In most cases, seasonal changes stirring up dust and wind are to blame. “Dust, wind and sand dynamics appear to be the main seasonal drivers of slope streak formation. Meteoroid impacts and quakes seem to be locally distinct, yet globally relatively insignificant drivers,” explains lead author Valentin Bickel from the University of Bern in Switzerland. Valentin used deep learning algorithms to analyse more than two million slope streaks in images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The resulting streak census locates them in five distinct hotspots on Mars between 2006 and 2024. “These observations could lead to a better understanding of what happens on Mars today. Obtaining long-term, continuous and global-scale observations that reveal a dynamic Mars is a key objective of present and future orbiters,” says Colin Wilson, ESA’s project scientist for the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. The Trace Gas Orbiter continues to image Mars from orbit to understand its ancient past and potential habitability. The spacecraft returns spectacular images and provides the best inventory of atmospheric gases and mapping of the planet’s surface for water-rich locations. Understanding the history of water on Mars and whether it once allowed life to flourish is at the heart of ESA’s ExoMars missions . The image covers an area of approximately six square kilometres and was captured on 24 December 2023. Mars location: 7.1°S, 173.4°E.

The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission along with a payload demonstration for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now Blue Origin is stepping back up to the plate to take another crack at launching its 98-meter-tall (321 ft) New Glenn rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Wednesday, Nov. 12. A confluence of poor weather, an errant cruise ship in the keep out zone and a ground systems issue at the pad were roadblocks to a Sunday launch attempt. In rescheduling the mission, Blue Origin said in a social media post that it was avoiding poor weather on Monday and Tuesday, but didn’t mention the status of the ground systems issue. The company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is now targeting liftoff from Launch Complex 36 during an 87-minute window that opens at 2:50 p.m. EST (1950 UTC) on Wednesday. Spaceflight Now will have live coverage beginning about three hours prior to liftoff. ﻿ The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance of liftoff during the window, citing no concerns for meteorological impacts that would prevent launch. Teams did highlight the booster recovery zone as watch item, stating that it was a “moderate” risk on a low-moderate-high scale. Space weather could also be an issue. On Tuesday afternoon, NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center forecast a G4 Severe Watch connected to a coronal mass ejection first detected on Sunday, Nov. 9. It noted that this is just the fourth G4 Watch issued this solar cycle, making it “very rare,” and added that impacts are expected “about midday on Nov. 12.” “A CME is anticipated to arrive at and partially impact Earth around midday, 12 Nov; with the potential for elevated geomagnetic response and dependent upon the orientation of the embedded magnetic field, potential exists for Severe Storm levels.” Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket designed for the NG-2 mission is pictured at sunset at Launch Complex 36, the evening of Nov. 8, 2025. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission along with a payload demonstration for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now Starting at stage separation, roughly three minutes after liftoff, teams will attempt to steer the first stage booster, named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds’, towards a landing in the Atlantic on a barge, ‘Jacklyn’, which is staged about 375 miles (603.5 km) downrange of the launch pad. Blue Origin attempted a similar landing with its first New Glenn booster, ‘So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance’, but the rocket failed to properly relight the three gimbaling BE-4 engines for the reentry burn. If all goes well, Blue Origin will become the second private company to perform a propulsive landing an orbital class rocket. It plans to reuse its boosters for up to 25 flights initially, assuming successful landings.

ROV will deploy following a booster landing and provide power, communication and pneumatic links between the booster and Jacklyn, according to Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp. Image: Blue Origin What’s onboard? Nestled within the New Glenn’s 7 m (23 ft) payload fairings are the twin spacecraft that makeup NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission as well as a ride share communications technology demonstration from Viasat. A little more than 33 minutes after liftoff, the two ESCAPADE satellites, Blue and Gold will deploy from a satellite adaptor called an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (ESPA) ring. Blue separates first and then Gold about 30 seconds later. They are being released into a highly elliptical orbit, “just shy of Earth escape velocity,” Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said in a social media post on Nov. 9. The twins will loiter in a novel so-called “kidney bean” shaped orbit around Lagrange Point 2 about a million miles from Earth for about a year. They will then use the Earth for a gravity assist around fall 2026 to begin a roughly 11-month journey to the Red Planet. They will arrive at Mars roughly two days apart when they will each perform a Mars insertion burn to enter into an elliptical orbit that will slowly be lowered into their target science orbit. They will be studying Mars’ magnetosphere to learn more about how it’s been influenced by space weather over time.

This is a demonstration of Viasat’s InRange launch telemetry relay solution, which is part of the company’s work under the NASA Communications Services Project. “InRange is a specific launch telemetry data relay service designed to support launch providers with responsive, real-time data transmission during launch using Viasat’s L-band network,” a Viasat spokesperson told Spaceflight Now in a statement. “This is a separate solution from Viasat’s high-capacity Ka-band data relay capability (i.e. Real-Time Space Relay), which is also being developed and will separately be demonstrated as part of our NASA CSP program work.”",

Illustration: Rocket Lab The inaugural flight of Rocket Lab’s reusable, medium-lift Neutron rocket is now set for 2026, instead of this year. The company said more testing and qualification work was needed. Sir Peter Beck, the CEO of Rocket Lab, announced the shift in plans during the third quarter earnings call with investors on Nov. 10. He said that the company’s goal is to get the rocket out to Launch Complex 3 at the Virginia Spaceport Authority’s (VSA) Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) within the first quarter of 2026 “with first launch thereafter.” “As always, this is a rocket program that’s been completed at a pace and a cost that nobody has achieved before and the financial and long-term impacts are insignificant to take a little bit more time to get it right,” Beck told investors on the call. Without naming names, Beck said others have raced to the launch pad without being fully ready for launch and that would not be their approach. He emphasized that Rocket Lab’s goal is to have a fully successful first flight and to make it to orbit without issue. “You won’t see us minimizing some qualifier about us just clearing the pad and claiming success and whatnot,” Beck said. “And that means we don’t want to learn something during Neutron’s first flight that could be learned on the ground during the testing phase. “At the end of the day, Neutron will fly when we’re very confident it’s ready and we’re not going to break the mold of the Rocket Lab magic.” A slide from Rocket Lab’s Q3 earnings presentation shown during an investor’s earning call on Nov. 10, 2025. Graphic: Rocket Lab While the 141-foot-tall (43 m) two-stage rocket is designed to be reusable, part of a successful first flight of Neutron won’t be proving reuse of the booster. Rocket Lab is still developing its 400-foot-long landing barge called ‘Return on Investment’, which Beck said should be ready to support Neutron’s second launch. Beck said that the methane and liquid oxygen powered Archimedes engines, which will power the liftoff of Neutron with 1.5 million pounds of thrust, continue to go through validation and qualification. He said they’re using two test stands at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi at a 20-7 rate: 20 hours a day, seven days a week. “The only way you can get through years of qualification that are always expected for an engine program is to squeeze years of hours into months,” Beck said. “As you can imagine, no weekends or evenings are left on the table at the Stennis test facility.” When asked by Michael Leshock of KeyBanc Capital Markets about how close they were to a finalized design of the Archimedes engine, Beck said the “engine design’s pretty stable at this point,” adding that Rocket Lab had “met all the performance criteria.” “With ascent there’s one set of environments and with descent, there’s an entirely new set of environments and much more challenging environments because your propellant will warm and lower pressures,” Beck said. “The vast, vast majority of all the components for Flight 1 engines are either complete or in some kind of form of build. “We’re iterating on the engine for sure, but the production machine is stood up and ready to support.” Archimedes full mission duration hot fire. Enjoy. pic.twitter.com/jF3I3zDM9G — Rocket Lab (@RocketLab) August 7, 2025 Leshock also asked whether the original budget prediction of Neutron was holding in the $250 million to $300 million range, Adam Spice, the Chief Financial Officer at Rocket Lab, said that the push of first launch from the end of 2025 into 2026 means that the company likely will have spent about $360 million on the program by the end of 2025. “As Pete mentioned, it’s about a $15 million impact on the human capital side of things per quarter,” Spice said. “When the program delays, you end up obviously incurring an extension of that staffing-related expenses to the program.” Spice said Rocket Lab expects to reach the peak of their quarterly expenditures on the Neutron program by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. In another part of the earnings call, Spice said the first launch of Neutron won’t include a customer on board, but said they do have “two, fully priced missions in the backlog right now.” “For Neutron, there’s a third contract admission… made to be a rideshare,” Spice said. “We don’t have that in the backlog because we don’t do that until we’ve actually added the payloads into the manifest.” Spice reported that Rocket Lab’s backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.1 billion with 47 percent coming from the launch side of the company versus their space systems business, which provides both spacecraft (like the two ESCAPADE satellites awaiting launch in Florida) and spacecraft components to customers. ﻿",

Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 10, 11:30 p.m. EST (04130UTC): SpaceX confirms deployment of the 29 Starlink satellites. The busiest spaceport in the world broke another record on Monday night. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was the 94th launch for an orbital class rocket from Florida, surpassing the total achieved in 2024. The total was a combination of Falcon 9 rockets as well as Atlas 5 and Vulcan rockets from United Launch Alliance and one New Glenn flight from Blue Origin. The Monday night mission that tipped the scales into the record books was Starlink 6-87, which added another 29 broadband internet satellites to the company’s mega-constellation in low Earth orbit. SpaceX accomplished liftoff from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:21 p.m. EST (0321 UTC). The launch was originally scheduled about five hours earlier in the day, but it was pushed later because the Federal Aviation Administration is limiting commercial launches to between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., due to the shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Launches add significantly to the workload of air traffic controllers due to the need to divert flights away from the launch danger area. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 60 percent chance for favorable weather during the launch window thanks to a “strong cold front” moving across the state on Monday. Meteorologists citied concerns from strong winds at liftoff as well as upper-level wind shear and somewhat questionable weather in the booster recovery zone near the Bahamas. “The front itself will cross the region Monday morning, ushering in a blast of strong northwesterly winds and chilly temps that will linger through at least the first half of Tuesday,” launch weather officers wrote. “As a result, the main concern for the primary launch window will be liftoff winds.” SpaceX used B1096 for the Starlink 6-87 mission, one of the newer Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet. Monday’s launch was its third flight following KF-01 for Amazon’s Project Kuiper and NASA’s IMAP rideshare mission earlier this year. Less than eight minutes after liftoff, B1096 performed an autonomous landing attempt on the drone ship, ‘Just Read the Instructions’. This was the 141st landing on this vessel and the 532nd booster landing to date. Records are made to be broken For more than half a decade, Florida’s spaceport, a combination of both NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, have been steadily increasing the number of orbital launches, thanks in large part to a yearly ramp up in flights from SpaceX. Between its two Falcon launch pads, Launch Complex 39A and Space Launch Complex 40, SpaceX will have launched 88 times after flying the Starlink 6-87 mission, about 95 percent of the launches from Florida’s Space Coast. Falcon launch #130 for 2025. The rolling 365 launch total is 166 launches! Notable records from this morning: * Fastest launch to launch from the same American Launch Pad at 55 Hrs, 29 minutes and 9 seconds * Fastest TE roll in to hangar for booster integration to launch at 12… https://t.co/kgrHZ7yXD5 — Kiko Dontchev (@TurkeyBeaver) October 16, 2025 The impact of some of those launches was reflected in October’s monthly CEO report delivered by Capt. John Murray, to the Port Canaveral Commission on Oct. 22. He noted that for all of Fiscal Year 2025 (Oct. 1, 2024 – Sept. 30, 2025) that there were 90 boosters brought into port along with 194 payload fairings, which he described as “quite significant.” Port Canaveral doesn’t explicitly break down its listing of “Space Component Recoveries” in its report. Presumably, these numbers reflect just SpaceX components, but Spaceflight Now did reach out to Port Canaveral to seek clarification. The ramp up in launch cadence required both increased agility on the part of launch operators, like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance as well as from those who manage the Eastern Range. Ahead of the Aug. 4, 2022, launches of both the SBIRS GEO-6 and the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter by ULA and SpaceX respectively, Spaceflight Now Reporter Will Robinson-Smith spoke with members of the 1st Range Ops Squadron (1 ROPS) in his capacity as a reporter for Spectrum News 13 at the time. Back then, a double launch day was something that hadn’t been achieved in Florida since the 1960s. U.S. Space Force 2nd Lt. Christian Jackson said that a ramped up launch cadence was “something that we train for every week” in preparation for a more airport-like flight environment. “Just a few years ago, they were launching maybe 12 rockets in a year. We’ve got about 60 plus on the manifest to finish out this year and there are hopes of possibly doing up to 100 launches next year,” Jackson said in 2022. “So, if we want to reach those numbers, we’re definitely going to get to that point where we’re launching over one in a day.” There have been many double launch days since then, with the most recent being September 25, which saw the launches of the Starlink 10-15 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket and the Kuiper Atlas 03 mission on an Atlas 5 551 rocket. Leadership at the Cape has been working to increase payload processing facility capacity to allow for further ramp up of missions, with facilities like one dedicated to Amazon’s Kuiper satellites coming online earlier this year.

Image: Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 9, 5 p.m. EST (2200 UTC): Blue Origin scrubbed the mission and is assessing its next launch opportunity. Blue Origin’s second New Glenn rocket will have to wait at least another day before it’s able to take flight. A launch attempt on Sunday, Nov. 9, of a pair of Mars-bound satellites for NASA along with a communications demonstration payload for Viasat was squashed due to the presence of cumulus clouds in the area of the pad. Launch teams were also working a ground systems issue heading into the launch readiness poll conducted at T-17 minutes as well as a cruise ship that was in the keep out zone. Blue Origin is assessing its next available launch opportunity. The company will also need to gain permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch a daylight flight, given the new commercial launch curfew put into effect beginning Nov. 10 in connection to the ongoing federal shutdown. When it’s able to launch, the 321-foot-tall (98 m) rocket will fly on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 65 percent chance for favorable weather at the opening Sunday’s launch opportunity, but that slides to 55 percent as time goes on. Meteorologists cited concerns with cumulus clouds, lightning and anvil clouds, noting that a cold front will be in place by Sunday. “As the front approaches the region from the northwest, there will be enough moisture in place for showers to form out ahead of and along the front,” launch weather officers wrote. “A few strong to severe thunderstorms may develop Sunday afternoon, with a small chance of a thunderstorm wind gust near 80 fps.” The 24-hour backup opportunity on Monday, Nov. 10, showed a 75 percent chance for favorable conditions at liftoff, but noted that the booster recovery risk was “moderate” on a scale of low-moderate-high. Like with the first New Glenn launch in January 2025, Blue Origin will attempt to land its first stage booster on its autonomous barge, Jacklyn. The 188-foot-tall (57.4 m) booster named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds’ will progress from using three to then one BE-4 engine to perform the final landing burn. Blue Origin previously said it plans to reuse this booster on its third flight if all goes well with this recovery effort. The company’s CEO, Dave Limp, said in a social media post on Wednesday that all will be well even if they’re unable to recover this booster. “We’ve got several more New Glenn boosters already in production,” Limp wrote. Blue Origin transported its New Glenn first stage booster, ‘Never Tell Me the Odds,’ from its facilities at Rocket Park to Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Oct. 8, 2025. Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now The New Glenn 2 (NG-2) mission will be the first time that Blue Origin’s orbital class rocket will carry customer payloads to space. The two ESCAPADE spacecraft — named ‘Blue’ and ‘Gold’ — were encapsulated inside the rocket’s 23-foot-diameter (7 m) payload fairings on Oct. 31. Blue Origin will perform two burns of the BE-3U engines on the rocket’s upper stage before the twin satellites deploy about 33 minutes after liftoff. The Viasat tech demo will activate about five minutes after the second ESCAPADE satellite, Gold, is released. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket designed for the NG-2 mission is pictured at sunset at Launch Complex 36, the evening of Nov. 8, 2025. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission along with a payload demonstration for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now The launch was coordinated by NASA’s Launch Services Program, based at the Kennedy Space Center. The rocket was assigned through the agency’s Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) launch services contract. The overall contract has a maximum total value of $300 million over a five-year ordering period. When it was assigned to Blue Origin with its New Glenn rocket, the ESCAPADE mission was scheduled to launch in late 2024 on the inaugural flight of the rocket. However, because New Glenn wasn’t ready to fly in time, the mission was moved to the rocket’s second launch. An artist’s rendering of the ESCAPADE mission patch. Graphic: University of California, Berkeley Mission to Mars NASA’s ESCAPADE’s science mission is led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of California, Berkeley, Space Science Laboratory. The mission is being done in collaboration with Rocket Lab, Advanced Space, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Northern Arizona University. The two spacecraft will work in tandem to better understand Mars’ magnetosphere and learn how its affected by space weather. That give researchers a better grasp on the climatological history of the Red Planet and how it lost its atmosphere. “Really excited to see (NASA’s) Heliophysics’ first mission to Mars and being able to deliver that space weather information that will hopefully help as humanity expands out into the cosmos,” Joseph Westlake, NASA Heliophysics Director, told Spaceflight Now in in an interview earlier this year. What began as the Mars Ion and Sputtering Escape Network (MISEN) concept proposal in October 2016 evolved in to ESCAPADE by July 2018. In June 2019, NASA picked it as one of three finalists as part of the agency’s Small, Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration or SIMPLEx for short. These types of missions are designed with a higher risk tolerance, a shorter timeline and a lower budget. Rocket Lab built EscaPADE twin spacecraft fully assembled and ready for shipping at the company’s Spacecraft Production Complex and headquarters in Long Beach, California, before shipping to the launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Image: Rocket Lab “We had three-and-a-half years to make two satellites to go to Mars. A typical timeline for a Mars mission is a decade,” said Christophe Mandy, during an August 2024 media tour of Rocket Lab’s Long Beach, California, facilities. “Big missions, like [Mars Sample Return], MSR started in 2002, so it’s already been over two decades. That’s the normal pace for an interplanetary mission,” Mandy said. “We had three-and-a-half years for everything.” Blue and Gold were built on Rocket Lab’s Explorer satellite bus, characterized by the company as a “high delta-V spacecraft with large propellant tanks, deep space capable avionics, and ranging transponders.” The Rocket Lab-built spacecraft for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission are encapsulated in the 7 meter payload fairings for Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. Image: Blue Origin “The Explorer product line has a very, very high mass fraction that is fuel,” Mandy said. “In the case of ESCAPADE, it’s almost 70 percent, which is an enormous number. So, if you are the type of mission that needs a lot of delta-V, you’ll probably go for Explorer.” The spacecraft will linger in Earth orbit for about a year before beginning a 10-month cruise to Mars. This altered trajectory, created by Advanced Space, was a result the launch delay of more than a year. The Mars orbit insertion burn is anticipated in September 2027 with checkouts and orbit refining to follow. The science mission is scheduled to last from June 2028 until May 2029.

Update Nov. 8, 7:30 a.m. EST (1230 UTC): SpaceX scrubbed the launch due to poor booster recovery weather. Following a last minute scrub Saturday morning, SpaceX launched a batch of Starlink satellites in the predawn hours of Sunday morning. The launch came as the Federal Aviation Administration readies a rollout of commercial launch restrictions for U.S. airspace. The company said poor weather in the booster recovery zone caused them stand down from Saturday’s launch opportunity, but conditions were enough improved to support Sunday’s launch. The Starlink 10-51 mission lifted off on a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 3:10 a.m. EST (0810 UTC). The rocket flew on a north-easterly trajectory upon leaving Florida’s Space Coast. ﻿ The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 95 percent chance for favorable weather at liftoff on Sunday, citing a small chance for interference from cumulus clouds. “A low-pressure system will begin to develop over the Midwest and track to the northeast, dragging a cold front into the Florida panhandle on Sunday, with rounds of prefrontal showers starting as early as Saturday afternoon,” launch weather officers wrote. “For the launch window early Sunday morning, weather appears quiet ahead of the incoming front with only a distant chance of a Cumulus Cloud Rule violation, though winds at the recovery site are likely to be elevated due to a tightening pressure gradient on the east side of the Carolina low.” SpaceX launched the mission using the Falcon 9 booster with the tail number B1069, which made its 28th flight. Its previous missions included CRS-24, OneWeb Launch #15 and Eutelsat Hotbird 13F. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1069 performed an autonomous landing on the drone ship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas’, positioned in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina. This was the 131st booster landing on this vessel and the 531st booster landing to date. SpaceX intends to deploy the 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites from the rocket’s upper stage a little more than an hour after liftoff.

Image: Michael Cain / Spaceflight Now Curfew coming The mission came days in advance of a new, emergency directive issued by the FAA on Thursday that restricts commercial space launches and reentries sanctioned by the FAA to take place between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. local time beginning at 6 a.m. EST on Nov. 10. In the face of the ongoing government shutdown, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is also serving as NASA’s acting administrator, also issued a “temporary 10 percent reduction in flights at 40 high traffic airports across the country.” Among those impacted airports are Orlando International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the two closest major airports to both Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg respectively. The launch curfew will have varying degrees of impact, depending on the interpretation of “commercial launch”. SpaceX announced five more Starlink missions between Nov. 10 and Nov. 19 and is also planning to launch the Transporter-15 mission on Nov. 11. Following a scrub Thursday night, United Launch Alliance’s next attempt to launch the ViaSat-3 F2 mission will also fall after the FAA’s launch restrictions go into effect. SpaceX does have some latitude with shuffling its launch times for its Starlink mission to fit the FAA’s new mandate. However, missions like Transporter-15 that seek to launch payloads into a Sun-synchronous orbit may need to seek special exemption. Spaceflight Now also reached out to the FAA for comment, but received the automated response: “Due to a lapse in funding, the FAA is not responding to routine media inquiries.” Rocket Lab for its part said that it shouldn’t face much impact from the decision. “We can confirm launches from [Launch Complex 1] in New Zealand are unaffected by the restrictions, as these launches do not operate in U.S. airspace,” the company said. “We also expect minimal impact to launches from LC-2 in Virginia.” A long-exposure shot of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket as it soars away from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center to begin the Starlink 10-51 mission on Nov. 9, 2025.

                "text": "United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5 551 rocket sits on the pad at Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The launch attempt on Nov. 6, 2025, was scrubbed due to a persistent issue with the booster’s liquid oxygen tank vent valve. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 7, 10 a.m. EST (1500 UTC): Adding comment from ULA CEO Tory Bruno, info about next steps. Update Nov. 6, 9:10 p.m. EST (0210 UTC): ULA scrubbed the launch and will target a new, yet to be announced, launch date. United Launch Alliance halted its Atlas 5 countdown for a second night in a row, scrubbing the launch of the ViaSat-3 F2 satellite. Liftoff from pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was scheduled for 10:16 p.m. EST (0316 UTC), but the valve issue that prevented a launch Wednesday night remained persistent on Thursday. Launch Director James Whelan scrubbed a launch attempt Wednesday night when a vent valve on the Atlas 5’s first stage liquid oxygen tank failed to work properly during final pre-launch checkouts. A little more than an hour before the Thursday night window opened, ULA said it was foregoing the launch attempt. “The launch of a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 carrying the ViaSat-3 F2 mission for Viasat is scrubbed for tonight’s launch attempt due to a reoccurrence of the issue with the Atlas 5 booster liquid oxygen tank vent valve,” the company wrote. “The team will evaluate the hardware, and we will release a new launch date when available.” At ULA’s Advanced Spaceflight Operations Center (ASOC), four miles south of the launch pad, launch controllers started the countdown for Thursday’s attempt shortly before 3 p.m. EST. The liquid oxygen tank on the Centaur upper stage reached flight levels and liquid oxygen loading on the booster was underway when the scrub was called shortly after 9 p.m. EST. Skies at Cape Canaveral were also overcast Thursday afternoon, with thick clouds and rain showers in the area. Launch Weather Officer Brian Belson from the 45th Weather Squadron at the Space Force’s Space Launch Delta 45 downgraded the outlook for launch, giving 50-50 odds of meeting the launch weather rules, with thick-layered clouds and rain being the primary concerns. In response to a social media question concerning the scrub on Thursday, ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno pointed to issues related to the weather. “Both scrubs were for the same issue, the booster’s LOX vent valve. We believe it absorbed moisture during the recent extreme rain at the pad and firmed ice during cryo tanking,” Bruno wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Gave it a good shot at drying and cycling in between attempts. Will need a more involved fix.” Multiple sources said that additional work won’t be possible at the launch pad, so the rocket will return to the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF), located about a third of a mile away from the pad itself. Nestled inside the rocket’s 5.4-meter diameter payload fairing is the 6-metric-ton ViaSat-3 F2 satellite, manufactured by Boeing. When the mission is ready to launch, the Atlas 5’s hydrogen-fueled Centaur upper stage will fire three times and use the great majority of its propellant to send the satellite on its way into a geostationary transfer orbit. This so-called Minimum Residual Shutdown will impart maximum velocity on the satellite once it is deployed 3.5 hours into flight, potentially extending its lifetime. The ViaSat-3 F2 satellite is moved within the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, where it was encapsulated in payload fairings for United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5 rocket. Image: Viasat This is the second satellite in the ViaSat-3 series. It follows the launch of the first spacecraft by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in 2023. That satellite, ViaSat-3 F1, suffered an issue with its antenna, which both delayed the start of service and resulted in a reduced capacity. Viasat officials said this new satellite will provide Ka-band network capabilities, adding more than 1 terabit per second (Tbps) of capacity to the company’s network over the Americas. Following months of on-orbit testing at its operating location of 79 degrees West longitude, the ViaSat-3 F2 spacecraft is expected to enter service in early 2026.",

The Atlas V will launch the ViaSat-3 F2 ultra-high-capacity broadband satellite. Image: United Launch Alliance Update Nov. 5, 11:30 p.m. EST (0430 UTC): ULA scrubbed the mission due to a valve issue. United Launch Alliance scrubbed the planned launch an Atlas 5 rocket Wednesday night due to the valve issue that was unable to be resolved in the launch window. The rocket is carrying a communications satellite for California-based communications company, Viasat. Following the scrub, the company said that “an issue encountered while cycling the booster liquid oxygen tank valve during final checkouts” forced them to stand down from a launch attempt and target a day later. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 41 is scheduled for 10:16 p.m. EST (0316 UTC), the opening of a 44-minute-long window. The rocket will head due east upon leaving Florida’s Space Coast. The 6-metric-ton satellite will be launched to a geosynchronous transfer orbit, deploying nearly 3.5 hours after the rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Spaceflight Now will have live coverage beginning about an hour prior to liftoff. On Tuesday, the 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 95 percent chance for favorable weather during the window. Meteorologist cited a small chance for interference from cumulus clouds. “High pressure will bring fair weather to the Space Coast on both the primary and backup days,” launch weather officers wrote. “For the primary window, a ridge axis over Central Florida will develop light, onshore winds and partly cloudy skies.” ULA is launching this mission using an Atlas 5 rocket in its 551 configuration. The 196-foot-tall (59.7 meters) rocket is supported by five solid rocket boosters, which combine with the RD-180 main engine to produce about 2.7 million pounds (12 megaNewtons) of thrust at liftoff. The SRBs will be jettisoned less than two minutes into the flight, followed by the payload fairings about a minute and a half later. It will take three separate firings of the RL10C-1-1 engine on the Centaur 3 upper stage to reach the correct orbit to release the ViaSat-3 F2 satellite. Following release, the upper stage will be placed in a so-called graveyard orbit nearly an hour later. This rocket has the designation of AV-100 and will be the 105th Atlas V rocket launched to date. After this mission, ULA will have 11 of these rockets remaining before it is officially retired: 6 – Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner 5 – Amazon’s Project Kuiper What’s onboard? This is the second satellite in the ViaSat-3 series and will operate in geostationary Earth orbit. It follows the launch of the first spacecraft by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in 2023.

                "text": "Polaris Dawn Commander Jared Isaacman sits down with Matt Anderson, the chief growth officer for the Space Force Association, during the second annual Spacepower Conference to discuss human spaceflight. Image: Adam Bernstein/Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 5, 8:10 a.m. EST (1310 UTC): Added comments from Sean Duffy. In a move that will feel like déja vu, President Donald Trump nominated commercial astronaut and entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to be the next NASA Administrator, less than six months after he had pulled Isaacman’s initial nomination for largely political reasons. The President made the announcement on his social media site, Truth Social, on Tuesday evening. “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,” Trump wrote. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Isaacman will take over the leadership role from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has served in the role as an acting administrator since July. In his own social media post, Isaacman thanked Duffy for his time in the acting administrator role and thanked those in the space community who continued to push for the President to reconsider Isaacman since his name was withdrawn initially. “And to the best and brightest at NASA, and to all the commercial and international partners, we have an extraordinary responsibility–but the clock is running,” Isaacman wrote in part on X. “The journey is never easy, but it is time to inspire the world once again to achieve the near-impossible–to undertake and accomplish big, bold endeavors in space…and when we do, we will make life better here at home and challenge the next generation to go even further.” Duffy also shared the news to his NASA-affiliated X account and said he would help Isaacman step into the role. “Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the honor to lead @NASA. We’ve made giant leaps in our mission to return to the Moon before China. It’s critical for out national security and national pride that we win the next space race,” Duffy wrote. “Congratulations to @rookissacman. I wish him all the success and will ensure the transition is seamless.” Representatives of notable space companies were quick to congratulate Isaacman on social media for his renomination to the role Wednesday evening. “Congrats @rookisaacman!!! @SpaceX is ready to serve,” wrote Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of Launch. “Together we will keep pushing the boundaries of space exploration!” “Congrats Jared! We look forward to working with you,” wrote Dave Limp, Blue Origin CEO. “The Commercial Space Federation (CSF) applauds the nomination of Jared Isaacman @rookisaacman to serve as NASA Administrator,” wrote the Commercial Space Federation. “As China seeks to challenge American space superiority at every turn, Jared has the vision, experience, and grit – the ‘right stuff’ – to lead NASA during this critical time.” What happened? Earlier in the year, Isaacman seemed to be on track to become the 15th Senate-confirmed NASA Administrator. Trump announced Isaacman would be nominated for the position in December 2024, more than a month before Trump was sworn into office. Isaacman sat before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee for his confirmation hearing in April and that group voted 19-9 to advance his nomination to a full vote of the Senate later that month. But in the weeks that followed, there was a very public back and forth between Trump and Elon Musk one of the President’s biggest political donors and the founder of SpaceX. The President asserted that “it was inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the space business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life.” When he announced the withdrawal of Isaacman’s nomination back on May 31, Trump said he would “soon announce a new nominee who will be mission aligned and put America first in space.” Instead, he tapped Duffy to be NASA Administrator on an interim basis, taking over from Kennedy Space Center Director Janet Petro, who temporarily led the agency from Trump’s inauguration in January until July 9. There has been a consistent chorus of support for Isaacman in the months since his nomination was withdrawn. Isaacman was also present at a White House dinner in early September, which featured more than a dozen tech executives, like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Just hours before Trump’s announcement online, Isaacman penned a lengthy post on X defending a document called “Athena”, an outline of how he’d planned to bring about his vision for NASA during his tenure. A 62-page version of this document was reportedly leaked to multiple members of the press. Isaacman said the full plan is in excess of 100 pages and was “always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.” He said the plan focused on five main priorities, which can be read in full here: Reorganize and empower American leadership in the high ground of space Solving the orbital economy NASA as a force multiplier for science Investing in the future “This plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved. The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman wrote. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.” What happens next? If confirmed, Isaacman will step into the NASA Administrator role just months ahead of the launch of the Artemis 2 mission, the first crewed launch of that program. There’s also the matter of the Artemis 3 architecture. In the midst of the shutdown, Duffy called for both Blue Origin and SpaceX to submit expedited plans for how to land humans on the Moon before the end of Trump’s second term in office, which ends on Jan. 20, 2029. NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens said last week in a statement that the plans were under evaluation. “NASA has received and will be evaluating plans from both SpaceX and Blue Origin for acceleration of HLS production. Following the shutdown, the agency will issue an RFI to the broader aerospace industry for their proposals,” Stevens wrote. “A committee of NASA subject matter experts will be assembled to evaluate each proposal and determine the best path forward to win the second space race given the urgency of adversarial threats to peace and transparency on the Moon.” In addition, with the ongoing budget battle on Capitol Hill, the matter of the President’s budget request will likely be high on the priority list for members of the Senate Commerce committee during his nomination hearing. It’s unclear when Isaacman will have a new nomination hearing.",

Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.",

The Kepler space telescope has made it possible to estimate $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, but estimates by different groups vary by more than an order of magnitude. We identify several causes for this range of estimates. We first review why, despite being designed to estimate $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, Kepler's observations are not sufficient for a high-confidence estimate, due to Kepler's detection limit coinciding with the $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ regime. This results in a need to infer $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, for example extrapolating from a regime of non-habitable zone, non-rocky exoplanets. We examine two broad classes of causes that can account for the large discrepancy in $\\eta_\\oplus$ found in the literature: a) differences in definitions and input data between studies, and b) fundamental limits in Kepler data that lead to large uncertainties and poor accuracy. We highlight the risk of large biases when using extrapolation to describe small exoplanet populations in the habitable zone. We discuss how $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ estimates based on Kepler data can be improved, such as reprocessing Kepler data for more complete, higher-reliability detections and better exoplanet catalog characterization.

Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5 $\\mu m$, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.",

These observations, conducted as part of Exoplanet Watch citizen science initiative, were analyzed with the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) pipeline to generate high-quality light curves and extract precise mid-transit times. By combining our new data with previously published observations, we refined the planet's ephemeris, reducing uncertainties in both the orbital period and mid-transit time.

Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inward to their present orbits \\cite{bitsch2021Dry}. Here, we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that releases silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing a significant amount of water up to a few tens of weight percent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation \\cite{misener2023Atmospheresa,schlichting2022Chemical}. Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

In this work, the measured PAH intensities of a range of disks are compared with ALMA dust continuum images, in order to test whether there is evidence that PAHs are frozen out on pebbles in dust traps and only sublimate under certain conditions. A sample is constructed from 26 T Tauri and Herbig disks located within 300 pc, with constraints on the 3.3 $\\mu$m PAH intensity and with high-resolution ALMA continuum data. The midplane temperature is derived using a power-law or with radiative transfer modeling. The warm dust mass is computed by integrating the flux within the 30 K radius and convert to a dust mass. A strong correlation with a Pearson coefficient of 0.88+/-0.07 between the 3.3 micron PAH intensity and the warm dust mass was found. The correlation is driven by the combination of deep upper limits and strong detections corresponding to a range of warm dust masses. Possible correlations with other disk properties like FUV radiation field or total dust mass are much weaker. Correlations with PAH features at 6.2, 8.6 and 11.3 micron are potentially weaker, but this could be explained by the smaller sample for which these data were available. The correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that PAHs are generally frozen out on pebbles in disks, and are only revealed in the gas phase if those pebbles have drifted towards warm dust traps inside the 30 K radius and vertically transported upwards to the disk atmosphere with sufficiently high temperature to sublimate PAHs into the gas phase. This is similar to previous findings on complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and provides further evidence that the chemical composition of the disk is governed by pebble transport.",

Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.",

Orbiting near Quaoar's unusual ring system, this new satellite has the potential to provide significant insights into the formation and evolution of Quaoar and its ring system. In this letter, we characterize the orbit of this newly discovered satellite, finding that it is likely on a $3.6^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$-day orbit, plausibly placing it near a 5:3 mean motion resonance with Quaoar's outermost known ring. Examining the possibility of observing the newly discovered satellite with further stellar occultations, we estimate that $\\sim$hundreds of observing stations are required for recovery, since phase information about its orbit was rapidly lost after the lone detection. We also attempted to recover the satellite in JWST NIRCam imaging of Quaoar, but find no convincing detection. This non-detection is limited by the accuracy of the available NIRCam PSF models, as well as the satellite's extreme faintness and close-in orbital separation. Therefore, current-generation telescopes will likely struggle to directly image this new satellite, but near-future 30-meter-class telescopes should prove capable of detecting it. Discovery of such a satellite provides evidence that the rings around Quaoar may have been part of an initially broad collisional disk that has evolved considerably since its formation. To further explore this hypothesis, we encourage follow-up observations of the rings and satellites with stellar occultations and direct imaging, as well as updated hydrodynamical, collisional, and tidal modeling of the system.",

The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.",

However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\\`eve image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.",

Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.\n  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.\n  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.\n  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils.

Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds.

Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV.

Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.",

In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters.

Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \\texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \\texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \\texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.",

By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization. We validate samsara on three benchmark problems: an analytic trans-dimensional distribution, joint inference of sine waves and Lorentzians in time series, and a Gaussian MM with an unknown number of components. In all cases, the code shows excellent agreement with analytical and Nested Sampling results.

Such arrays can have simpler receiver designs with room-temperature low-noise amplifiers and direct sampling to achieve, greatly reducing the cost per antenna.

In this work, our objective was to implement a first-stage digital signal processing system for the ARGOS demonstrator array, providing digitization, channelization, delay correction and frequency-dependent complex gain correction. The system is intended to produce delay and phase corrected dual-polarization channelized voltages in the frequency range 1-3 GHz with a nominal channel bandwidth of 1 MHz.

We use Xilinx Vitis HLS C++ to develop the required firmware as a set of customizable modules suitable for rapid prototyping. We performed hardware verification of the channel response of the critically sampled PFB and of the delay correction, showing both to be consistent with theoretical expectations.

However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\\`eve image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.",

The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.",

The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.",

Using the high-resolution Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we generate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions (e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the importance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM mass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface brightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor limiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial resolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher sensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM kinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and comparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest kinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI velocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center requires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs. Additionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected kinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of gas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically, but this fraction drops to <40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results provide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that recovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission will require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution.",

Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a $z=7.88$ protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of ${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c}}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 11.4\\pm0.2$, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c},\\ z=0}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 13.7\\pm0.6$).

Comparison to other $z\\gtrsim7$ protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes.

To properly validate and characterise the family of galactic progenitors, it is important to take into account all the effects that can shape the distribution of tracers in the Galaxy. First among the often overlooked actors of galactic dynamics is the rotating bar of the Milky Way that can affect orbital tracers in multiple ways. We want to fully characterise the effect of the rotating bar of the Milky Way on the distribution of galactic tracers, provide diagnostics helpful in identifying its effect and explore the implications for the search and identification of substructures. We use the in-house Orbital Integration Tool (OrbIT), built to include the full effect of the bar and exploit its multidimensional output to perform a complete dynamical characterisation of a large sample of carefully selected Milky Way stars with very precise astrometry. We identify conspicuous overdensities in several orbital parameter spaces and verify that they are caused by the bar-induced resonances. We also show how contamination by trapped tracers provides local density enhancements that mimic the clumping usually attributed to genuine substructures. We provide a new and expedite way of identifying resonant loci and, consequently, to estimate the contribution of stars trapped into orbital resonances to phase-space overdensities previously identified as candidate relics of past merging events. Among those analysed here, we found that the detections of Cluster 3 and Shakti seem to have gained a non-negligible boost from resonance-trapped stars. Nyx is the most extreme case, with 70% of assigned member stars lying on resonant orbit, strongly suggesting that it is not the genuine relic of a merger event but an overdensity caused by bar-induced resonances",

In this paper, we systematically explore uncertainties associated with modeling chemical enrichment in dwarf galaxies. We repeatedly simulate a single EDGE-INFERNO dwarf ($M_{\\star} \\approx 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$), varying the chemical yields of massive stars, the timing and yields of SNeIa, and the intrinsic stochasticity that arises from sampling individual stars and galaxy formation chaoticity. All simulations are high-resolution (3.6 pc), cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations that track the stellar evolution of all individual stars with masses $>0.5\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We find that variations in SNIa assumptions make the largest difference in mean abundance ratios and [Fe/H], highlighting the importance of detailed SNIa modeling even in such low-mass reionization-limited galaxies. In contrast, different massive star yields, accounting (or not) for stellar rotation, result in mean abundances comparable to those arising from stochasticity. Nonetheless, they significantly affect the shape of abundance trends with [Fe/H], for example, through the existence (or not) of a bimodality in the [X/Fe] - [Fe/H] planes, particularly in [Al/Fe]. Finally, we find that the variance arising from random sampling severely limits the interpretation of single galaxies. Our analysis showcases the power of star-by-star cosmological models to unpick how both systematic uncertainties (e.g., assumptions in low-metallicity chemical enrichment) and statistical uncertainties (e.g., averaging over enough galaxies and stars within a galaxy) affect the interpretation of chemical observables in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.",

Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and 150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast, G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+, with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+ along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging, though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical morphologies.

Filaments of the cosmic web provide key environments that channel the growth of structures. Guided by predictions from cosmological simulations, we study the morphological distribution of galaxies in the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, a prominent filamentary complex at 70 Mpc. We focus on how galaxy morphology and structural disturbances relate to position within the filament network and to proximity to dense nodes. Our sample is built from a spectroscopic catalogue cross-matched with deep r-band CFHT/MegaCam imaging from UNIONS and additional time, enabling the detection of low-surface-brightness features and extended outer structures. Morphologies are determined both visually and through structural parameters extracted from surface-brightness profiles using AutoProf and AstroPhot. The 3D filamentary skeleton of Perseus-Pisces is reconstructed with the DisPerSE algorithm, providing distances from each galaxy to the nearest filament and to group or cluster centres. The 3D mapping reveals a network of interconnected sub-filaments converging around the Pisces cluster, forming a complex, multi-branched structure that likely shapes environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We observe clear morphological and stellar-mass segregation: massive early-type galaxies (E/S0) concentrate along filament spines and near dense nodes, while late-type and irregular systems are more broadly dispersed. About 10-13% of galaxies show strong signs of gravitational interaction, with stellar-halo asymmetries particularly common in filaments and groups. These findings underline the dual influence of filamentary environments, which both host evolved early-type systems and foster local tidal interactions and pre-processing that modify galaxy morphology.",

The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.",

The formation and evolution of such clusters and their stellar populations remain unclear. Both single and binary cluster channels may lead to such CSPs. In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.",

To showcase its enhanced capabilities, we conducted new S-band observations of the galaxy NGC 2997 in full polarization. The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral galaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization. Performing a rotation measure (RM) synthesis allowed us to measure Faraday RMs in the galaxy, a signature of regular magnetic fields. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to study the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM synthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line of sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high resolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an unprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure. Our sector-based analysis of the RMs across azimuthal regions reveals the existence of modes of the large-scale magnetic field in NGC 2997. The variations in the RM values along the azimuthal angle reveal smoothly changing phase shifts between the rings, without the previously reported field reversal at about 3 kpc radius between the central region and disk. In this work, for the first time, a Fourier analysis has been applied to RM data averaged in sectors of rings in the disk plane of a spiral galaxy. Our Fourier analysis of the RM map shows three different large-scale field modes detected in the disk of NGC 2997. After applying a geometric modification, even multiples of the first mode were detected, as predicted from theoretical studies of dynamo action in a spiral galaxy with symmetric spiral structure. Our new method opens up new possibilities for investigating magnetic fields in spiral galaxies.",

The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\\times10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials.

We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.",

The surviving dwarf galaxies orbiting the MW serve as exceptional laboratories for studying the unique properties of these systems. Their metal-poor environments and shallow gravitational potentials likely drive significant differences in star formation and star cluster properties compared to those in the MW. Using high-quality near-infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, we determined abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Ce for 74 stars in four MW satellite dwarf galaxies: Fornax, Sextans, Draco, and Carina. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of $\\alpha$ elements (e.g., [Si/Fe]) strongly correlates with galaxy luminosity (and hence mass), underscoring the critical role of galaxy mass in shaping chemical evolution. These dwarf galaxies exhibit [Al/Fe$]\\sim -0.5$, which is comparable to those of the metal-poor stars in the MW. Additionally, we identified nitrogen-rich field stars in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, which display distinct metallicities compared to its known globular clusters (GCs). If these stars originated in GCs and subsequently escaped, their presence suggests we are observing relics of destroyed GCs, offering possible evidence of cluster disruption.",

This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic conformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is seen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This paper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral fitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy properties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance. We find the clear signature of age conformity, as previously seen, but no clear evidence for conformity in metallicity or abundance ratios. The offsets showing age conformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies. There is a suggestion in these data that lower velocity dispersion satellites have increased [alpha/Fe] compared to a control sample of passive galaxies, however this needs further observations to be verified. Our results also suggest an intriguing turnover in the age trends of the satellites at the highest velocity dispersion, perhaps reflecting the onset of environment-related processes in the most massive groups.",

Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\\gtrsim 20\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.",

The results from this study include some of the most spectacular intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations, combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time delays, down to a minute scale.

To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas} = \\Omega_{\\rm cdm} / \\Omega_{\\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \\propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass .",

Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.",

We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles.

This analysis favors the presence of a Compton-thick, heavily obscured AGN in SBS~0335-052E, consistent with its observed X-ray weakness. From the SED fitting, we estimate an AGN bolometric luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = 1.2\\times10^{43}\\ {\\rm erg\\ s^{-1}}$, which implies a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm BH} \\simeq 10^{5}\\ M_\\odot$ if the AGN is accreting at the Eddington limit.

In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UVLF of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a redshift- and mass-dependent duty cycle linked to the duration of star formation. This duty cycle increases towards higher redshifts, requiring either an enhanced production of UV radiation or increased star formation efficiency at z>10 to match the JWST UVLFs, but declines at lower redshifts (5<=9) and towards low-mass halos to remain consistent with the bias and HST UVLF measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires the characteristic star formation timescale to be longer in massive halos, and to decrease with redshift at fixed halo mass, evolving from ~ 85 Myr at z=6 to ~ 45 Myr at z=14 for $10^{10} M_\\odot$ halos. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-dependent escaping ionizing efficiency ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm esc} \\equiv f_{\\rm esc} \\times \\xi_{\\rm ion}$), whose population-averaged value gradually increases with redshift and corresponds to $\\langle f_{\\rm esc} \\rangle \\sim$ 15% at z=5 for a fixed value of $\\xi_{\\rm ion} = 10^{25.23}$ erg$^{-1}$ Hz across all galaxies, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints.

It also incorporates relatively low-mass MBH seeds down to $5\\times10^{4} M_{\\odot}$, providing a more complete picture of LISA MBH mergers. We find that LISA MBH mergers initially have high eccentricities, peaking around $e_0 = 0.8$ across all redshifts. Accounting for this boosts the event rate from 5.6 yr$^{-1}$ (if circular orbits are assumed) to 10.5 yr$^{-1}$. This enhancement is largely due to additional inspiral sources that will coalesce after LISA's observation, which constitute $46\\%$ of detected events.This underscores the importance of LISA's sensitivity to the early inspiral phase, especially for eccentric binaries that emit gravitational waves across a wider frequency band. Most LISA events in ASTRID arise from $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}\\sim10^{5-6}\\ M_\\odot$, low-redshift ($z<2$) and low mass-ratio ($q\\sim0.01$-$0.1$) mergers. Accounting for eccentricity broadens the detectable MBH mass range up to $10^{9} M_\\odot$ and shifts the peak of detectable mergers to a lower redshift $z_{\\rm peak}=0.8$. This implies that the most massive LISA events may also be PTA sources. We predict LISA events to be in various galaxy environments, including many low-mass satellite galaxies.

Such systems offer a unique opportunity to study disk assembly by analyzing the stellar populations of each component. Using integral field spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we identified a sample of 120 CR disk galaxies (65 reliable and 55 probable systems) by inspecting their kinematic maps and analyzing the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, which was recovered nonparametrically. Of these, 74 CR galaxies have not been reported in previous studies. For one-third of our sample, we further derived the ages and metallicities of stars for both disks via a spectral decomposition technique. We show that the observed spatial bimodality -- where the CR disk either is concentrated in the central region (inner counterrotation) or dominates the outer part of the galaxy (outer counterrotation) -- is driven by differences in the stellar mass and angular momentum of the CR disk. The wide range of stellar metallicities observed in CR disks suggests that no single source of external material is solely responsible for the formation of counterrotation in all galaxies; instead, proposed mechanisms such as merger with gas-rich satellites, accretion from cosmic filaments, and exchange of gas between neighboring galaxies can dominate in individual cases.",

The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc, comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses at z~6 as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web.Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, have similar size and stellar mass surface densities to quiescent galaxies at z~4-5.

We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.",

They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\\simeq80\\times160$ and $80\\times100~\\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\\mathrm{h}/M_\\odot)\\simeq13.2\\pm0.3$ and $12.8\\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.",
