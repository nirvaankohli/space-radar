                "text": "5 min read Preparations for Next Moonwalk Simulations Underway (and Underwater) Set to launch no earlier than Nov. 16, Sentinel-6B will continue the data record now being collected by its twin satellite Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, which lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in November 2020 aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket shown here. SpaceX Set to track sea levels across more than 90% of Earth’s ocean, the mission must first get into orbit. Here’s what to expect. Sentinel-6B, an ocean-tracking satellite jointly developed by NASA and ESA (European Space Agency), is ready to roll out to the launch pad, packed into the payload fairing of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Launch is targeted at 12:21 a.m. EST, Monday, Nov. 17 (9:21 p.m. PST, Sunday, Nov. 16). Once it lifts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the satellite will ride out a 57-minute sequence of events ending in spacecraft separation, when the satellite detaches from the rocket. Then Sentinel-6B’s real work begins. Orbiting Earth every 112 minutes at 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) per second, the satellite will eventually take over for its twin, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched five years ago, to continue a multidecade dataset for sea level measurements from space. Those measurements, along with atmospheric data the mission gathers, will help improve public safety and city planning while protecting coastal infrastructure, including power plants and defense interests. NASA will also use the data to refine atmospheric models that support the safe re-entry of Artemis astronauts. Get the Sentinel-6B Press Kit Here’s a closer look at what lies ahead for the satellite in the coming days. Launch timeline Measuring 19.1 feet (5.82 meters) long and 7.74 feet (2.36 meters) high (including the communications antennas), the satellite weighs in at around 2,600 pounds (1,200 kilograms) when loaded with propellant at launch. The satellite will lift off from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg. If needed, backup launch opportunities are available on subsequent days, with the 20-second launch window occurring about 12 to 13 minutes earlier each day. A little more than two minutes after the Falcon 9 rocket lifts off, the main engine cuts off. Shortly after, the rocket’s first and second stages separate, followed by second-stage engine start. The reusable Falcon 9 first stage then begins its automated boost-back burn to the launch site for a powered landing. About three minutes after launch, the two halves of the payload fairing, which protected the satellite as it traveled through the atmosphere, separate and fall safely back to Earth. The first cutoff of the second stage engine takes place approximately eight minutes after liftoff, at which point the launch vehicle and the spacecraft will be in a temporary “parking” orbit. The second stage engine fires a second time about 44 minutes later, and about 57 minutes after liftoff, the rocket and the spacecraft separate. Roughly seven minutes after that, the satellite’s solar panels deploy. Sentinel-6B is expected to make first contact with ground controllers about 35 minutes after separation (roughly an hour and a half after liftoff) — a major milestone indicating that the spacecraft is healthy. Science mission Following launch operations, the team will focus on its next challenge: getting the spacecraft ready for science operations. Once in orbit, Sentinel-6B will fly about 30 seconds behind its twin, the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite. When scientists and engineers have completed cross-calibrating the data collected by the two spacecraft, Sentinel-6B will take over the role of providing primary sea level measurements while Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will move into a different orbit. From there, researchers plan to use measurements from Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich for different purposes, including helping to map seafloor features (variations in sea surface height can reveal variations in ocean floor features, such as seamounts). Sentinel-6B is part of a U.S.-European mission that will continue 30-year-plus record of sea-level measurements. Its observations will help build an accurate picture of local and global sea surface heights to support storm forecasting, secure coastal infrastructure, and help optimize commercial activities, such as shipping. NASA/JPL-Caltech Where to find launch coverage Launch day coverage of the mission will be available on the agency’s website , including links to live streaming and blog updates beginning no earlier than 11 p.m. EST, Nov. 16, as the countdown milestones occur.

With launch set for no earlier than 12:21 a.m. EST Monday, Nov. 17, Sentinel-6B is the latest satellite in a series of spacecraft NASA and its partners have used to measure sea levels since 1992. Their data has helped meteorologists improve hurricane forecasts, managers protect infrastructure, and coastal communities plan.

The European Commission contributed funding support while France’s space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales) provided technical expertise. Here are six things to know about Sentinel-6B and the broader Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission: 1. Sentinel-6B will deliver data on about 90% of Earth’s ocean, providing direct benefits to humanity . Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multidecade dataset for sea level measurements from space. This data is key to helping improve public safety, city planning, and protecting commercial and defense interests. Pioneered by NASA and its partners, the dataset enables users in government, industry, and the research community to better understand how sea levels change over time. Combined with information from other NASA satellites, data from Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS is vital for tracking how heat and energy move through Earth’s seas and atmosphere, as well as for monitoring ocean features such as currents and eddies. The measurements come courtesy of a radar altimeter that measures sea levels for nearly all of Earth’s ocean, providing information on large-scale currents that can aid in commercial and naval navigation, search and rescue, and the tracking of debris and pollutants from disasters at sea. Sentinel-6B is part of a U.S.-European mission that will continue 30-year-plus record of sea-level measurements. Its observations will help build an accurate picture of local and global sea surface heights to support storm forecasting, secure coastal infrastructure, and help optimize commercial activities, such as shipping. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech 2. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission helps NASA prepare for the next phase of space exploration . The better we understand Earth, the better NASA can carry out its mission to explore the universe. Data from the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission is used to refine the Goddard Earth Observing System atmospheric forecast models, which the NASA Engineering Safety Center uses to plan safer reentry of astronauts returning from Artemis missions. Additionally, changes to Earth’s ocean, observed by satellites, can have measurable effects beyond our planet. For instance, while the Moon influences ocean tides on Earth, changes in those tides can also exert a small influence on the Moon. Data from Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS can help improve understanding of this relationship, knowledge that can contribute to future lunar exploration missions. 3. The Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission helps the U.S. respond to challenges by putting actionable information into the hands of decision-makers . Data collected by the mission helps city planners, as well as local and state governments, to make informed decisions on protecting coastal infrastructure, real estate, and energy facilities. The mission’s sea level data also improves meteorologists’ weather predictions, which are critical to commercial and recreational navigation. By enhancing weather prediction models, data provided by Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS improves forecasts of hurricane development, including the likelihood of storm intensification, which can aid disaster preparedness and response. Get the Sentinel-6B Press Kit 4. Data from Sentinel-6B will support national security efforts . The ocean and atmosphere measurements from Sentinel-6B will enable decision-makers to better protect coastal military installations from such events as nuisance flooding while aiding national defense efforts by providing crucial information about weather and ocean conditions. The satellite will do so by feeding near-real time data on Earth’s atmosphere and seas to forward-looking weather and ocean models. Since the measurements are part of a long-term dataset, they also can add historical context that puts the new data in perspective. 5. The Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission’s direct observation of sea levels delivers information critical to protecting coastlines, where nearly half of the world’s population lives . Sea level rise varies from one area to another, meaning that some coastlines are more vulnerable than others to flooding, erosion, and saltwater contamination of underground freshwater supplies, the latter of which threatens farmland and drinking water. Sea level measurements from Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, and soon, Sentinel-6B, form the basis of U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites, and other coastal assets. Knowing which regions are more vulnerable to these risks will enable U.S. industries and emergency managers to make better-informed decisions about transportation and commercial infrastructure, land-use planning, water management, and adaptation strategies. 6. The international collaboration behind the mission enables the pooling of capabilities, resources, and expertise . The multidecadal dataset that this mission supports is the result of years of close work between NASA and several collaborators, including NASA, ESA, EUMETSAT, CNES, and NOAA. By pooling expertise and resources, this partnership has delivered cost-effective solutions that have made precise, high-impact data available to industry and government agencies alike.

With its open-source code, HDTN paves the way for collaboration, innovation, and adoption across the rapidly expanding commercial space industry, offering near real-time communication capabilities. Looking ahead, HDTN could form the foundation of a solar system-wide internet, supporting data exchange between Earth, spacecraft, and even future missions involving human travel to the Moon and Mars.

ESA/Hubble & NASA, A. Filippenko; Acknowledgment: M. H. Özsaraç Stars of all ages are on display in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image of the sparkling spiral galaxy called NGC 6000, located 102 million light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. NGC 6000 has a glowing yellow center and glittering blue outskirts. These colors reflect differences in the average ages, masses, and temperatures of the galaxy’s stars. At the heart of the galaxy, the stars tend to be older and smaller. Less massive stars are cooler than more massive stars, and somewhat counterintuitively, cooler stars are redder, while hotter stars are bluer. Farther out along NGC 6000’s spiral arms, brilliant star clusters host young, massive stars that appear distinctly blue. Hubble collected the data for this image while surveying the sites of recent supernova explosions in nearby galaxies. NGC 6000 hosted two recent supernovae: SN 2007ch in 2007 and SN 2010as in 2010. Using Hubble’s sensitive detectors, researchers can discern the faint glow of supernovae years after the initial explosion. These observations help constrain the masses of supernovae progenitor stars and can indicate if they had any stellar companions. By zooming in to the right side of the galaxy’s disk in this image, you can see a set of four thin yellow and blue lines. These lines are an asteroid in our solar system that was drifting across Hubble’s field of view as it gazed at NGC 6000. The four lines are due to four different exposures recorded one after another with slight pauses in between. Image processors combined these four exposures to create the final image. The lines appear dashed with alternating colors because each exposure used a filter to collect very specific wavelengths of light, in this case around red and blue. Having these separate exposures of particular wavelengths is important to study and compare stars by their colors — but it also makes asteroid interlopers very obvious!

NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity acquired this image at the start of the drilling activity at the “Valle de la Luna” site, “caught in the act” as this image was taken on Oct. 19, 2025. Curiosity used its Front Hazard Avoidance Camera (Front Hazcam) on Sol 4693, or Martian day 4,693 of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, at 01:54:37 UTC. NASA/JPL-Caltech By Susanne P. Schwenzer, Professor of Planetary Mineralogy at The Open University, U.K. Earth planning date: Friday, Oct. 31, 2025 I am writing this blog and it’s still daytime — and I am looking forward to accompanying one of my favorite kids to trick-and-treating afterwards. That’s a new feeling for me because I am usually in the U.K., which means my Curiosity shifts start in the late afternoon when everyone else finishes working. But for now, I am in the U.S. (Houston, Texas), and it’s daytime, which is a lovely change, especially today as I don’t have to hide from trick-and-treaters’ interruptions but instead can give out all the candy they can possibly eat! Looking forward to that… but before, let’s see what Curiosity was up to this week! You’ll have seen the blog by my colleague Bill, “Searching for Answers at Monte Grande,” about our analysis of the “Valle de la Luna” sample with CheMin and SAM EGA. This week we were continuing the SAM analysis of the 44th drilled sample, which always takes a lot of power, so that leaves less room for other investigations. Hence, you might notice that there were fewer ChemCam and Mastcam activities. The rover also did not drive while sample is still in the turret ready for delivery of the next SAM activities. Curiosity has now completed the deliveries to CheMin and SAM, though, and the last action in Friday’s plan was to clean out the remaining sample from the drill in preparation for driving away here in Monday’s plan. In Monday’s plan we’ll reposition the rover to get a very good look at the potential next drill targets on the ridge. We’ve been able to scout them already in previous images and have a few candidates, but decision-making will require images from Monday’s parking position, since we are currently parked in a hollow and cannot really see what’s up on the ridge. That said, being stationary has always been a golden opportunity for looking at wind action, and this week was no difference as Mastcam looked at the drill fines several times over the time we were stationary, to ascertain the safety for MAHLI to approach — and of course to use those images for atmospheric science, too. In addition, Mastcam took the opportunity to get comprehensive imaging of the entire area. There are several mosaics that document the near-field, for example at target “Nazareth.” In the mid- and far-field distances, Mastcam assembled a large mosaic on “Monte Grande” and “Ticaco” to document the different rocks in the surrounding ridge walls and wider afield. There are so many interesting textures and alteration features, alongside troughs and fractures, that the team will have a fun time analyzing them all in great detail individually, as well as their relationships to each other. ChemCam has investigated the Valle de la Luna drill hole and tailings as per the usual cadence of post-drilling activities, and in addition investigated target Nazareth to understand how the block that Curiosity drilled might vary chemically. Another ChemCam target was “Pachica,” as the team observed many nodules in this target and we are interested in their chemical variability and “Palpana,” a more smooth block. Further investigations of the Valle de la Luna drill hole with ChemCam are targets “Anapia” and “Bandara” to further investigate the chemical diversity of the drill target block. ChemCam Remote Micro Imager (RMI) observations were also taken in the near-field and farther away. In the near-field, RMI images are documenting further details on the Valle de la Luna drill hole and its tailings, while further afield the Monte Grande Wall is one of the RMI targets alongside with other details in the boxwork ridges around us. On Friday, the RMI was pointed far uphill to continue imaging the yardang unit, which is one of our next goals in the longer term future. In addition to all the drill activities and rock investigations, the atmosphere received attention too. We have the usual cadence of environmental investigations, building our long-term pressure, temperature, and humidity record of Mars; and we observe the atmospheric opacity, dust-devil activities, and clouds. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week, when we will decide on the second drill target in this area, this time on the ridge. Let’s see what block will be looking best, both from a science and an engineering point of view – we’ve got a short list of candidates; the detailed images are for Monday’s plan. Meanwhile, we’ll enjoy trick-and-treating here on Earth and our weekends while Curiosity finishes the drill activities at Valle de la Luna. Want to read more posts from the Curiosity team?

NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity acquired this image at the start of the drilling activity at the “Valle de la Luna” site, “caught in the act” as this image was taken on Oct. 19, 2025. Curiosity used its Front Hazard Avoidance Camera (Front Hazcam) on Sol 4693, or Martian day 4,693 of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, at 01:54:37 UTC. NASA/JPL-Caltech By Susanne P. Schwenzer, Professor of Planetary Mineralogy at The Open University, U.K. Earth planning date: Friday, Oct. 31, 2025 I am writing this blog and it’s still daytime — and I am looking forward to accompanying one of my favorite kids to trick-and-treating afterwards. That’s a new feeling for me because I am usually in the U.K., which means my Curiosity shifts start in the late afternoon when everyone else finishes working. But for now, I am in the U.S. (Houston, Texas), and it’s daytime, which is a lovely change, especially today as I don’t have to hide from trick-and-treaters’ interruptions but instead can give out all the candy they can possibly eat! Looking forward to that… but before, let’s see what Curiosity was up to this week! You’ll have seen the blog by my colleague Bill, “Searching for Answers at Monte Grande,” about our analysis of the “Valle de la Luna” sample with CheMin and SAM EGA. This week we were continuing the SAM analysis of the 44th drilled sample, which always takes a lot of power, so that leaves less room for other investigations. Hence, you might notice that there were fewer ChemCam and Mastcam activities. The rover also did not drive while sample is still in the turret ready for delivery of the next SAM activities. Curiosity has now completed the deliveries to CheMin and SAM, though, and the last action in Friday’s plan was to clean out the remaining sample from the drill in preparation for driving away here in Monday’s plan. In Monday’s plan we’ll reposition the rover to get a very good look at the potential next drill targets on the ridge. We’ve been able to scout them already in previous images and have a few candidates, but decision-making will require images from Monday’s parking position, since we are currently parked in a hollow and cannot really see what’s up on the ridge. That said, being stationary has always been a golden opportunity for looking at wind action, and this week was no difference as Mastcam looked at the drill fines several times over the time we were stationary, to ascertain the safety for MAHLI to approach — and of course to use those images for atmospheric science, too. In addition, Mastcam took the opportunity to get comprehensive imaging of the entire area. There are several mosaics that document the near-field, for example at target “Nazareth.” In the mid- and far-field distances, Mastcam assembled a large mosaic on “Monte Grande” and “Ticaco” to document the different rocks in the surrounding ridge walls and wider afield. There are so many interesting textures and alteration features, alongside troughs and fractures, that the team will have a fun time analyzing them all in great detail individually, as well as their relationships to each other. ChemCam has investigated the Valle de la Luna drill hole and tailings as per the usual cadence of post-drilling activities, and in addition investigated target Nazareth to understand how the block that Curiosity drilled might vary chemically. Another ChemCam target was “Pachica,” as the team observed many nodules in this target and we are interested in their chemical variability and “Palpana,” a more smooth block. Further investigations of the Valle de la Luna drill hole with ChemCam are targets “Anapia” and “Bandara” to further investigate the chemical diversity of the drill target block. ChemCam Remote Micro Imager (RMI) observations were also taken in the near-field and farther away. In the near-field, RMI images are documenting further details on the Valle de la Luna drill hole and its tailings, while further afield the Monte Grande Wall is one of the RMI targets alongside with other details in the boxwork ridges around us. On Friday, the RMI was pointed far uphill to continue imaging the yardang unit, which is one of our next goals in the longer term future. In addition to all the drill activities and rock investigations, the atmosphere received attention too. We have the usual cadence of environmental investigations, building our long-term pressure, temperature, and humidity record of Mars; and we observe the atmospheric opacity, dust-devil activities, and clouds. Of course, we are all looking forward to next week, when we will decide on the second drill target in this area, this time on the ridge. Let’s see what block will be looking best, both from a science and an engineering point of view – we’ve got a short list of candidates; the detailed images are for Monday’s plan. Meanwhile, we’ll enjoy trick-and-treating here on Earth and our weekends while Curiosity finishes the drill activities at Valle de la Luna. Want to read more posts from the Curiosity team?

NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Written by William Farrand, Senior Research Scientist, Space Science Institute Earth planning date: Friday, Oct. 24, 2025 Curiosity has successfully drilled its 44 th hole on Mars, which is a major milestone in our investigation of the enigmatic “boxwork unit,” a region of resistant ridges surrounding pits or “hollows” of less-resistant rock. The drilling took place over the past weekend within the “Monte Grande” hollow at the “Valle de la Luna” target. Rover planning this week consisted of ensuring that the granular drill tailings from Valle de la Luna were transferred to the SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) and CheMin (X-ray diffraction) instruments, and analyzing the results. Results from these instruments, which will provide mineralogical and other compositional information, will be especially critical for determining how the boxwork features formed, since chemistry from the APXS and ChemCam instruments and reflectance spectra from ChemCam have revealed subtle, but not striking, differences between the rocks making up the ridges and those making up the hollows. Thus, a compositional explanation for the differences between the two terrain types has yet to be determined. While these internal studies of the Valle de la Luna samples were going on, remote sensing data were collected by Mastcam of a series of targets, as well as atmospheric remote sensing. Among the Mastcam studies being conducted is a photometry study, a kind of study usually only carried out during an extended stationary period, such as the current drill campaign. Photometry is the study of changes in the apparent reflected brightness of rocks and soils based on the illumination geometry (for example, whether the Sun is low on the horizon or high in the sky). During this photometry campaign, multiple images are collected of the same target regions at different times of day. In the final plan of the week, as part of the ongoing assessment of the Valle de la Luna sample, material will undergo an evolved gas analysis (EGA) in which the drilled sample is baked in an oven in SAM and volatile molecules including H 2 O, CO 2 , and SO 2 are released and used to further aid in the characterization of the target materials. Mastcam observations will include further images collected as part of the photometry campaign. Also mosaics of the west wall of the Monte Grande hollow will be collected as well as several atmospheric measurements. Next week the rover will continue analyzing the drilled sample with more SAM experiments, and also analyze the tailings. The team is also starting to search for a suitable drilling location on a ridge as the next drilling site, in order to compare with the results from the Monte Grande hollow.

NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity acquired this image showing the “Valle de la Luna” block in the “Monte Grande” hollow, a location it targeted for drilling the weekend of Oct. 18-19, 2025. Curiosity captured the image with its Front Hazard Avoidance Camera (Front Hazcam) on Oct. 12, 2025 — Sol 4687, or Martian day 4,687 of the Mars Science Laboratory mission — at 23:11:12 UTC. NASA/JPL-Caltech Written by Catherine O’Connell-Cooper, APXS Payload Uplink/Downlink Lead, University of New Brunswick Earth planning date: Friday, Oct. 17, 2025 Curiosity has been investigating the “boxwork unit” for several months now. Readers might remember we drilled at the edge of the boxwork at “Altadena ,” back in June. Since then, we have driven just under a kilometer across the boxwork unit (about 0.6 miles) and now we are ready to acquire the next drill target, in an area where the structure is really well preserved. The boxwork structures are a series of ridges and hollows, so our plan is to drill within one of the hollows and then on one of the adjacent ridges. On Monday, we did our drill triage on “Valle de la Luna” within the hollow “ Monte Grande ” – a multi-instrument endeavor. We assessed the chemistry using APXS and ChemCam, to make sure it is within the expected range and not something completely different from the bedrock compositions we have been tracking. The rover planners (RPs) use a “pre-load” test, putting pressure on the bedrock surface to characterize how the rover arm and rock might behave during drilling. We take multiple images (including images before and after the pre-load test), using MAHLI and Mastcam to help the RPs assess the surface of the potential drill area. Finding a suitable place to drill in the hollows was a challenge, as the low point of each hollow (what we are most interested in) is often covered in sand or small pebbles, with just sparse bedrock peeking through, as you can see in the accompanying image . However, we got lucky here in Monte Grande. The chemistry shows that this rock is within our expected compositional range. The MAHLI images show a smoother surface in the center of the brushed area (where the drill will focus), and the before-and-after images indicated that the rock reacted well to the pre-load test. On Friday, the RPs and mission scientists pored over the data in a very intensive meeting called the “Target Acquisition Assessment Meeting,” or TAAM. We have drilled 43 holes on Mars now and it’s always nerve-wracking, waiting to see if the information we gathered during our initial contact science and preload give us a go-ahead. About midway through the planning day, we got the news that TAAM said yes to drilling here, so we will drill on the first sol of this weekend plan. If the drill is successful, we will have no contact science for at least a week, as the arm cannot be deployed during a drill campaign. Normally, as I’m APXS PUDL (responsible for uplinking new APXS targets and assessing downlink of previous targets), the idea of a week with no contact science would be disappointing to me — but not during a drill campaign! CheMin (Chemistry Mineralogy) and SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) will use the drilled sample to give us extra depth of information, looking at mineralogy and composition in a way that is not possible for APXS and ChemCam. We can then use that drill data to help us interpret the APXS and ChemCam data and better understand the formation of these boxworks, especially if we can pair it with a suitable target on the ridges. In the meantime of course, we continue to monitor the atmosphere and environment around us. The Mastcam team are planning some amazing images from this site and ChemCam will continue to characterize the nearby bedrock and image the far-off hills.

The satellite was carried into orbit on a Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, US. Sentinel-6B follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, which was launched in 2020. The mission is the reference radar altimetry mission that continues the vital record of sea-surface height measurements until at least 2030. Copernicus Sentinel-6 has become the gold standard reference mission to monitor and record sea-level rise. The mission’s main instrument is the Poseidon-4 dual-frequency (C-band and Ku-band) radar altimeter. Developed by ESA, the altimeter measures sea-surface height. It also captures the height of ‘significant’ waves as well as wind speed to support operational oceanography.",

It looks dark because it is cooler than its surroundings, being around 10 000 °C compared to the surrounding million-degree plasma. When viewed against the background of space, the hovering plasma is referred to as a prominence. When viewed against the Sun's surface, it is called a filament.

Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet’s once thick atmosphere. The centerpiece of Amazon- and Blue Origin-founder Jeff Bezos’ space ambitious, the towering 321-foot tall New Glenn rocket’s seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. EST, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust. The launching came four days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space where a powerful solar storm buffeted the upper atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads. The storm had abated by launch time Thursday and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast. The New Glenn first stage standing on the deck of Blue Origin’s recovery vessel Jacklyn. Image: Blue Origin. The New Glenn’s maiden flight last January successfully boosted a Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in its attempt to reach an off-shore landing ship, named after Bezos’ mother Jacklyn. The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Thursday, nicknamed “Never Tell Me The Odds,” featured a variety of upgrades to improve performance. As with SpaceX booster landings, the New Glenn stage fired three engines to slow down for re-entry, then restarted the engines just before touchdown, followed by landing on the power of a single engine. This time around, the booster made an on-target, picture-perfect landing, prompting another round of raucous cheers and applause from Blue Origin workers. Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight. New Glenn thunders away from its launch pad in near perfect weather conditions. Image: Adam Bernstein/Spaceflight Now. The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own. The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the UC-Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. The probes were built for UC-Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions. ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each. New Glenn soars above a cruise ship departing Port Canaveral. Image: John Pisani/Spaceflight Now. The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA’s Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn’s second flight. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026. To make Wednesday’s New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions. The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon’s orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth. Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by on-board propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won’t reach the red planet until September 2027. “We are using a very flexible … approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,” said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator. “This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future … we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering” without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open. While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the martian atmosphere. Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits. Without a protective global field like Earth’s, the martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms. Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the martian atmosphere. Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet’s atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood. “We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,” Lillis said. “We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. “We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn’t been so for about two billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.” Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes. “If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,” Lillis said. “You can’t be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We’ve never had that before, and that’s really exciting.”",

                "text": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 551 rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to begin the ViaSat-3 F2 mission for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 13, 11 p.m. EST (0400 UTC): ULA launched its Atlas 5 rocket and completed the first two out of three upper stage engine burns. United Launch Alliance launched its Atlas 5 rocket Thursday night, which carried a communications satellite for California-based communications company, Viasat. The launch came a week after the mission was scrubbed due to a faulty liquid oxygen tank vent valve on the Atlas booster. ULA rolled the rocket back to the Vertical Integration Facility about third of a mile away, replaced it with a new valve and returned the rocket to the pad on Nov. 12. The 6-metric-ton satellite will be launched to a geosynchronous transfer orbit, deploying nearly 3.5 hours after the rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 41 happened at 10:04 p.m. EST (0304 UTC), the opening of a 44-minute-long window. The rocket headed due east upon leaving Florida’s Space Coast. ﻿ ULA launched this mission using an Atlas 5 rocket in its 551 configuration. The 196-foot-tall (59.7 meters) rocket was supported by five solid rocket boosters, which combined with the RD-180 main engine to produce about 2.7 million pounds (12 megaNewtons) of thrust at liftoff. The SRBs jettisoned less than two minutes into the flight, followed by the payload fairings about a minute and a half later. It will take three separate firings of the RL10C-1-1 engine on the Centaur 3 upper stage to reach the correct orbit to release the ViaSat-3 F2 satellite. Following release, the upper stage will be placed in a so-called graveyard orbit nearly an hour later. This rocket had the designation of AV-100 and was the 105th Atlas V rocket launched to date. Following this launch, ULA now has 11 of these rockets remaining before it is officially retired: 6 – Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner 5 – Amazon’s Project Kuiper A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 551 rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to begin the ViaSat-3 F2 mission for Viasat. Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now What’s onboard? This was the second satellite in the ViaSat-3 series that will operate in geostationary Earth orbit, following the launch of the first spacecraft in 2023. After the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite launched on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, it suffered an issue with its antenna, which both delayed the start of service and resulted in a reduced capacity. Viasat officials said ahead of the launch that this new satellite will provide needed Ka-band network capabilities, adding more than 1 terabits per second (Tbps) of capacity to the network over the Americas. Following a months of on-orbit testing at its operating slog of 79 degrees West longitude, the ViaSat-3 F2 spacecraft is expected to enter service in early 2026. The ViaSat-3 F2 satellite is moved within the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, where it was encapsulated in payload fairings for United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5 rocket. Image: Viasat “Beyond an incredible capacity increase, ViaSat-3 F2’s dynamic beam forming capabilities will greatly benefit our customers by efficiently deploying bandwidth to the highest demand places, allowing us to scale performance and the number and density of users,” said Mark Dankberg, Chairman and CEO of Viasat, in a statement. “These capabilities will continue to fuel our successful, multi-orbit service offerings, including service platforms such as Viasat Amara, NexusWave, and a resilient, hybrid SATCOM architecture for government.” The satellite is built on Boeing’s 702MP+ platform, which uses electric propulsion and solar arrays, the latter of which is from Boeing subsidiary, Spectrolab. Boeing is supporting Viasat in both launch operations and post-deployment checkouts. “Our goal is to enable missions with reliability and timely delivery,” said Michelle Parker, Vice President of Boeing Space Mission Systems. “With ViaSat‑3 F2, we leveraged proven 702 heritage, advanced power systems and all‑electric propulsion to enable high-speed connectivity for users who rely on it.”",

        "rep_text": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 551 rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to begin the ViaSat-3 F2 mission for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 13, 11 p.m. EST (0400 UTC): ULA launched its Atlas 5 rocket and completed the first two out of three upper stage engine burns. United Launch Alliance launched its Atlas 5 rocket Thursday night, which carried a communications satellite for California-based communications company, Viasat. The launch came a week after the mission was scrubbed due to a faulty liquid oxygen tank vent valve on the Atlas booster. ULA rolled the rocket back to the Vertical Integration Facility about third of a mile away, replaced it with a new valve and returned the rocket to the pad on Nov. 12. The 6-metric-ton satellite will be launched to a geosynchronous transfer orbit, deploying nearly 3.5 hours after the rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 41 happened at 10:04 p.m. EST (0304 UTC), the opening of a 44-minute-long window. The rocket headed due east upon leaving Florida’s Space Coast. ﻿ ULA launched this mission using an Atlas 5 rocket in its 551 configuration. The 196-foot-tall (59.7 meters) rocket was supported by five solid rocket boosters, which combined with the RD-180 main engine to produce about 2.7 million pounds (12 megaNewtons) of thrust at liftoff. The SRBs jettisoned less than two minutes into the flight, followed by the payload fairings about a minute and a half later. It will take three separate firings of the RL10C-1-1 engine on the Centaur 3 upper stage to reach the correct orbit to release the ViaSat-3 F2 satellite. Following release, the upper stage will be placed in a so-called graveyard orbit nearly an hour later. This rocket had the designation of AV-100 and was the 105th Atlas V rocket launched to date. Following this launch, ULA now has 11 of these rockets remaining before it is officially retired: 6 – Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner 5 – Amazon’s Project Kuiper A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 551 rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to begin the ViaSat-3 F2 mission for Viasat. Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now What’s onboard? This was the second satellite in the ViaSat-3 series that will operate in geostationary Earth orbit, following the launch of the first spacecraft in 2023. After the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite launched on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, it suffered an issue with its antenna, which both delayed the start of service and resulted in a reduced capacity. Viasat officials said ahead of the launch that this new satellite will provide needed Ka-band network capabilities, adding more than 1 terabits per second (Tbps) of capacity to the network over the Americas. Following a months of on-orbit testing at its operating slog of 79 degrees West longitude, the ViaSat-3 F2 spacecraft is expected to enter service in early 2026. The ViaSat-3 F2 satellite is moved within the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, where it was encapsulated in payload fairings for United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5 rocket. Image: Viasat “Beyond an incredible capacity increase, ViaSat-3 F2’s dynamic beam forming capabilities will greatly benefit our customers by efficiently deploying bandwidth to the highest demand places, allowing us to scale performance and the number and density of users,” said Mark Dankberg, Chairman and CEO of Viasat, in a statement. “These capabilities will continue to fuel our successful, multi-orbit service offerings, including service platforms such as Viasat Amara, NexusWave, and a resilient, hybrid SATCOM architecture for government.” The satellite is built on Boeing’s 702MP+ platform, which uses electric propulsion and solar arrays, the latter of which is from Boeing subsidiary, Spectrolab. Boeing is supporting Viasat in both launch operations and post-deployment checkouts. “Our goal is to enable missions with reliability and timely delivery,” said Michelle Parker, Vice President of Boeing Space Mission Systems. “With ViaSat‑3 F2, we leveraged proven 702 heritage, advanced power systems and all‑electric propulsion to enable high-speed connectivity for users who rely on it.”",

Image: Blue Origin Blue Origin is stepping back up to the plate and will take another crack at launching its 98-meter-tall (321 ft) rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday, Nov. 13. A confluence of poor weather, an errant cruise ship in the keep out zone and a ground systems issue at the pad were roadblocks to a Sunday launch attempt. Its second attempt on Wednesday was halted because a trio of coronal mass ejections from the Sun created too high of a probability for strong geomagnetic storms. The company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is now targeting liftoff from Launch Complex 36 during an 88-minute window that opens at 2:57 p.m. EST (1957 UTC). Spaceflight Now will have live coverage beginning about three hours prior to liftoff. ﻿ The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance of liftoff during the window, citing no concerns for meteorological impacts that would prevent launch. Teams were also watching for the lingering effects of the geomagnetic storms, placing them as a “moderate” risk to launch on Thursday. On Tuesday afternoon, NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center forecast a G4 Severe Watch connected to a coronal mass ejection first detected on Sunday, Nov. 9. It noted that this is just the fourth G4 Watch issued this solar cycle, making it “very rare,” and added that impacts are expected “about midday on Nov. 12.” “A CME is anticipated to arrive at and partially impact Earth around midday, 12 Nov; with the potential for elevated geomagnetic response and dependent upon the orientation of the embedded magnetic field, potential exists for Severe Storm levels.” In its latest update on Thursday morning, NOAA issued an extended warning for “Proton 10MeV Integral Flux above 10pfu.” This type of so-called Solar Proton Event or SPE for short can be harmful to spacecraft electronics. ﻿ Roughly three minutes after liftoff, Blue Origin will attempt to propel the first stage booster, named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds’, towards a landing on its barge, ‘Jacklyn’, which is staged about 375 miles (603.5 km) downrange of the launch pad. The company attempted a similar landing with its first New Glenn booster, ‘So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance’, but it failed to properly relight the three gimbaling BE-4 engines for the reentry burn. If all goes well, Blue Origin will become the second private company to perform a propulsive landing an orbital class rocket. It plans to reuse its boosters for up to 25 flights initially, assuming successful landings.

Nestled within the New Glenn’s 7 m (23 ft) payload fairings are the twin spacecraft that makeup NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission as well as a ride share communications technology demonstration from Viasat. A little more than 33 minutes after liftoff, the two ESCAPADE satellites, Blue and Gold will deploy from a satellite adaptor called an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (ESPA) ring. Blue separates first and then Gold about 30 seconds later. They are being released into a highly elliptical orbit, “just shy of Earth escape velocity,” Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said in a social media post on Nov. 9. The twins will loiter in a novel so-called “kidney bean” shaped orbit around Lagrange Point 2 about a million miles from Earth for about a year. They will then use the Earth for a gravity assist around fall 2026 to begin a roughly 11-month journey to the Red Planet. They will arrive at Mars roughly two days apart when they will each perform a Mars insertion burn to enter into an elliptical orbit that will slowly be lowered into their target science orbit. They will be studying Mars’ magnetosphere to learn more about how it’s been influenced by space weather over time.

Illustration: Rocket Lab The inaugural flight of Rocket Lab’s reusable, medium-lift Neutron rocket is now set for 2026, instead of this year. The company said more testing and qualification work was needed. Sir Peter Beck, the CEO of Rocket Lab, announced the shift in plans during the third quarter earnings call with investors on Nov. 10. He said that the company’s goal is to get the rocket out to Launch Complex 3 at the Virginia Spaceport Authority’s (VSA) Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) within the first quarter of 2026 “with first launch thereafter.” “As always, this is a rocket program that’s been completed at a pace and a cost that nobody has achieved before and the financial and long-term impacts are insignificant to take a little bit more time to get it right,” Beck told investors on the call. Without naming names, Beck said others have raced to the launch pad without being fully ready for launch and that would not be their approach. He emphasized that Rocket Lab’s goal is to have a fully successful first flight and to make it to orbit without issue. “You won’t see us minimizing some qualifier about us just clearing the pad and claiming success and whatnot,” Beck said. “And that means we don’t want to learn something during Neutron’s first flight that could be learned on the ground during the testing phase. “At the end of the day, Neutron will fly when we’re very confident it’s ready and we’re not going to break the mold of the Rocket Lab magic.” A slide from Rocket Lab’s Q3 earnings presentation shown during an investor’s earning call on Nov. 10, 2025. Graphic: Rocket Lab While the 141-foot-tall (43 m) two-stage rocket is designed to be reusable, part of a successful first flight of Neutron won’t be proving reuse of the booster. Rocket Lab is still developing its 400-foot-long landing barge called ‘Return on Investment’, which Beck said should be ready to support Neutron’s second launch. Beck said that the methane and liquid oxygen powered Archimedes engines, which will power the liftoff of Neutron with 1.5 million pounds of thrust, continue to go through validation and qualification. He said they’re using two test stands at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi at a 20-7 rate: 20 hours a day, seven days a week. “The only way you can get through years of qualification that are always expected for an engine program is to squeeze years of hours into months,” Beck said. “As you can imagine, no weekends or evenings are left on the table at the Stennis test facility.” When asked by Michael Leshock of KeyBanc Capital Markets about how close they were to a finalized design of the Archimedes engine, Beck said the “engine design’s pretty stable at this point,” adding that Rocket Lab had “met all the performance criteria.” “With ascent there’s one set of environments and with descent, there’s an entirely new set of environments and much more challenging environments because your propellant will warm and lower pressures,” Beck said. “The vast, vast majority of all the components for Flight 1 engines are either complete or in some kind of form of build. “We’re iterating on the engine for sure, but the production machine is stood up and ready to support.” Archimedes full mission duration hot fire.

In another part of the earnings call, Spice said the first launch of Neutron won’t include a customer on board, but said they do have “two, fully priced missions in the backlog right now.” “For Neutron, there’s a third contract admission… made to be a rideshare,” Spice said. “We don’t have that in the backlog because we don’t do that until we’ve actually added the payloads into the manifest.” Spice reported that Rocket Lab’s backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.1 billion with 47 percent coming from the launch side of the company versus their space systems business, which provides both spacecraft (like the two ESCAPADE satellites awaiting launch in Florida) and spacecraft components to customers. ﻿",

Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 10, 11:30 p.m. EST (04130UTC): SpaceX confirms deployment of the 29 Starlink satellites. The busiest spaceport in the world broke another record on Monday night. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was the 94th launch for an orbital class rocket from Florida, surpassing the total achieved in 2024. The total was a combination of Falcon 9 rockets as well as Atlas 5 and Vulcan rockets from United Launch Alliance and one New Glenn flight from Blue Origin. The Monday night mission that tipped the scales into the record books was Starlink 6-87, which added another 29 broadband internet satellites to the company’s mega-constellation in low Earth orbit. SpaceX accomplished liftoff from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:21 p.m. EST (0321 UTC). The launch was originally scheduled about five hours earlier in the day, but it was pushed later because the Federal Aviation Administration is limiting commercial launches to between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., due to the shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Launches add significantly to the workload of air traffic controllers due to the need to divert flights away from the launch danger area. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 60 percent chance for favorable weather during the launch window thanks to a “strong cold front” moving across the state on Monday. Meteorologists citied concerns from strong winds at liftoff as well as upper-level wind shear and somewhat questionable weather in the booster recovery zone near the Bahamas. “The front itself will cross the region Monday morning, ushering in a blast of strong northwesterly winds and chilly temps that will linger through at least the first half of Tuesday,” launch weather officers wrote. “As a result, the main concern for the primary launch window will be liftoff winds.” SpaceX used B1096 for the Starlink 6-87 mission, one of the newer Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet. Monday’s launch was its third flight following KF-01 for Amazon’s Project Kuiper and NASA’s IMAP rideshare mission earlier this year. Less than eight minutes after liftoff, B1096 performed an autonomous landing attempt on the drone ship, ‘Just Read the Instructions’. This was the 141st landing on this vessel and the 532nd booster landing to date. Records are made to be broken For more than half a decade, Florida’s spaceport, a combination of both NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, have been steadily increasing the number of orbital launches, thanks in large part to a yearly ramp up in flights from SpaceX. Between its two Falcon launch pads, Launch Complex 39A and Space Launch Complex 40, SpaceX will have launched 88 times after flying the Starlink 6-87 mission, about 95 percent of the launches from Florida’s Space Coast. Falcon launch #130 for 2025. The rolling 365 launch total is 166 launches!

John Murray, to the Port Canaveral Commission on Oct. 22. He noted that for all of Fiscal Year 2025 (Oct. 1, 2024 – Sept. 30, 2025) that there were 90 boosters brought into port along with 194 payload fairings, which he described as “quite significant.” Port Canaveral doesn’t explicitly break down its listing of “Space Component Recoveries” in its report. Presumably, these numbers reflect just SpaceX components, but Spaceflight Now did reach out to Port Canaveral to seek clarification. The ramp up in launch cadence required both increased agility on the part of launch operators, like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance as well as from those who manage the Eastern Range. Ahead of the Aug. 4, 2022, launches of both the SBIRS GEO-6 and the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter by ULA and SpaceX respectively, Spaceflight Now Reporter Will Robinson-Smith spoke with members of the 1st Range Ops Squadron (1 ROPS) in his capacity as a reporter for Spectrum News 13 at the time. Back then, a double launch day was something that hadn’t been achieved in Florida since the 1960s. U.S. Space Force 2nd Lt. Christian Jackson said that a ramped up launch cadence was “something that we train for every week” in preparation for a more airport-like flight environment. “Just a few years ago, they were launching maybe 12 rockets in a year. We’ve got about 60 plus on the manifest to finish out this year and there are hopes of possibly doing up to 100 launches next year,” Jackson said in 2022. “So, if we want to reach those numbers, we’re definitely going to get to that point where we’re launching over one in a day.” There have been many double launch days since then, with the most recent being September 25, which saw the launches of the Starlink 10-15 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket and the Kuiper Atlas 03 mission on an Atlas 5 551 rocket. Leadership at the Cape has been working to increase payload processing facility capacity to allow for further ramp up of missions, with facilities like one dedicated to Amazon’s Kuiper satellites coming online earlier this year.

                "text": "Blue Origin scrubbed a launch attempt of the NG-2 mission on Nov. 9, 2025, due to cumulus clouds in the area. Image: Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 9, 5 p.m. EST (2200 UTC): Blue Origin scrubbed the mission and is assessing its next launch opportunity. Blue Origin’s second New Glenn rocket will have to wait at least another day before it’s able to take flight. A launch attempt on Sunday, Nov. 9, of a pair of Mars-bound satellites for NASA along with a communications demonstration payload for Viasat was squashed due to the presence of cumulus clouds in the area of the pad. Launch teams were also working a ground systems issue heading into the launch readiness poll conducted at T-17 minutes as well as a cruise ship that was in the keep out zone. Blue Origin is assessing its next available launch opportunity. The company will also need to gain permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch a daylight flight, given the new commercial launch curfew put into effect beginning Nov. 10 in connection to the ongoing federal shutdown. When it’s able to launch, the 321-foot-tall (98 m) rocket will fly on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 65 percent chance for favorable weather at the opening Sunday’s launch opportunity, but that slides to 55 percent as time goes on. Meteorologists cited concerns with cumulus clouds, lightning and anvil clouds, noting that a cold front will be in place by Sunday. “As the front approaches the region from the northwest, there will be enough moisture in place for showers to form out ahead of and along the front,” launch weather officers wrote. “A few strong to severe thunderstorms may develop Sunday afternoon, with a small chance of a thunderstorm wind gust near 80 fps.” The 24-hour backup opportunity on Monday, Nov. 10, showed a 75 percent chance for favorable conditions at liftoff, but noted that the booster recovery risk was “moderate” on a scale of low-moderate-high. Like with the first New Glenn launch in January 2025, Blue Origin will attempt to land its first stage booster on its autonomous barge, Jacklyn. The 188-foot-tall (57.4 m) booster named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds’ will progress from using three to then one BE-4 engine to perform the final landing burn. Blue Origin previously said it plans to reuse this booster on its third flight if all goes well with this recovery effort. The company’s CEO, Dave Limp, said in a social media post on Wednesday that all will be well even if they’re unable to recover this booster. “We’ve got several more New Glenn boosters already in production,” Limp wrote. Blue Origin transported its New Glenn first stage booster, ‘Never Tell Me the Odds,’ from its facilities at Rocket Park to Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Oct. 8, 2025. Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now The New Glenn 2 (NG-2) mission will be the first time that Blue Origin’s orbital class rocket will carry customer payloads to space. The two ESCAPADE spacecraft — named ‘Blue’ and ‘Gold’ — were encapsulated inside the rocket’s 23-foot-diameter (7 m) payload fairings on Oct. 31. Blue Origin will perform two burns of the BE-3U engines on the rocket’s upper stage before the twin satellites deploy about 33 minutes after liftoff. The Viasat tech demo will activate about five minutes after the second ESCAPADE satellite, Gold, is released. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket designed for the NG-2 mission is pictured at sunset at Launch Complex 36, the evening of Nov. 8, 2025. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission along with a payload demonstration for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now The launch was coordinated by NASA’s Launch Services Program, based at the Kennedy Space Center. The rocket was assigned through the agency’s Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) launch services contract. The overall contract has a maximum total value of $300 million over a five-year ordering period. When it was assigned to Blue Origin with its New Glenn rocket, the ESCAPADE mission was scheduled to launch in late 2024 on the inaugural flight of the rocket. However, because New Glenn wasn’t ready to fly in time, the mission was moved to the rocket’s second launch. An artist’s rendering of the ESCAPADE mission patch. Graphic: University of California, Berkeley Mission to Mars NASA’s ESCAPADE’s science mission is led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of California, Berkeley, Space Science Laboratory. The mission is being done in collaboration with Rocket Lab, Advanced Space, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Northern Arizona University. The two spacecraft will work in tandem to better understand Mars’ magnetosphere and learn how its affected by space weather. That give researchers a better grasp on the climatological history of the Red Planet and how it lost its atmosphere. “Really excited to see (NASA’s) Heliophysics’ first mission to Mars and being able to deliver that space weather information that will hopefully help as humanity expands out into the cosmos,” Joseph Westlake, NASA Heliophysics Director, told Spaceflight Now in in an interview earlier this year. What began as the Mars Ion and Sputtering Escape Network (MISEN) concept proposal in October 2016 evolved in to ESCAPADE by July 2018. In June 2019, NASA picked it as one of three finalists as part of the agency’s Small, Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration or SIMPLEx for short. These types of missions are designed with a higher risk tolerance, a shorter timeline and a lower budget.

        "rep_text": "Blue Origin scrubbed a launch attempt of the NG-2 mission on Nov. 9, 2025, due to cumulus clouds in the area. Image: Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 9, 5 p.m. EST (2200 UTC): Blue Origin scrubbed the mission and is assessing its next launch opportunity. Blue Origin’s second New Glenn rocket will have to wait at least another day before it’s able to take flight. A launch attempt on Sunday, Nov. 9, of a pair of Mars-bound satellites for NASA along with a communications demonstration payload for Viasat was squashed due to the presence of cumulus clouds in the area of the pad. Launch teams were also working a ground systems issue heading into the launch readiness poll conducted at T-17 minutes as well as a cruise ship that was in the keep out zone. Blue Origin is assessing its next available launch opportunity. The company will also need to gain permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch a daylight flight, given the new commercial launch curfew put into effect beginning Nov. 10 in connection to the ongoing federal shutdown. When it’s able to launch, the 321-foot-tall (98 m) rocket will fly on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 65 percent chance for favorable weather at the opening Sunday’s launch opportunity, but that slides to 55 percent as time goes on. Meteorologists cited concerns with cumulus clouds, lightning and anvil clouds, noting that a cold front will be in place by Sunday. “As the front approaches the region from the northwest, there will be enough moisture in place for showers to form out ahead of and along the front,” launch weather officers wrote. “A few strong to severe thunderstorms may develop Sunday afternoon, with a small chance of a thunderstorm wind gust near 80 fps.” The 24-hour backup opportunity on Monday, Nov. 10, showed a 75 percent chance for favorable conditions at liftoff, but noted that the booster recovery risk was “moderate” on a scale of low-moderate-high. Like with the first New Glenn launch in January 2025, Blue Origin will attempt to land its first stage booster on its autonomous barge, Jacklyn. The 188-foot-tall (57.4 m) booster named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds’ will progress from using three to then one BE-4 engine to perform the final landing burn. Blue Origin previously said it plans to reuse this booster on its third flight if all goes well with this recovery effort. The company’s CEO, Dave Limp, said in a social media post on Wednesday that all will be well even if they’re unable to recover this booster. “We’ve got several more New Glenn boosters already in production,” Limp wrote. Blue Origin transported its New Glenn first stage booster, ‘Never Tell Me the Odds,’ from its facilities at Rocket Park to Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Oct. 8, 2025. Image: John Pisani / Spaceflight Now The New Glenn 2 (NG-2) mission will be the first time that Blue Origin’s orbital class rocket will carry customer payloads to space. The two ESCAPADE spacecraft — named ‘Blue’ and ‘Gold’ — were encapsulated inside the rocket’s 23-foot-diameter (7 m) payload fairings on Oct. 31. Blue Origin will perform two burns of the BE-3U engines on the rocket’s upper stage before the twin satellites deploy about 33 minutes after liftoff. The Viasat tech demo will activate about five minutes after the second ESCAPADE satellite, Gold, is released. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket designed for the NG-2 mission is pictured at sunset at Launch Complex 36, the evening of Nov. 8, 2025. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE mission along with a payload demonstration for Viasat. Image: Adam Bernstein / Spaceflight Now The launch was coordinated by NASA’s Launch Services Program, based at the Kennedy Space Center. The rocket was assigned through the agency’s Venture-Class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) launch services contract. The overall contract has a maximum total value of $300 million over a five-year ordering period. When it was assigned to Blue Origin with its New Glenn rocket, the ESCAPADE mission was scheduled to launch in late 2024 on the inaugural flight of the rocket. However, because New Glenn wasn’t ready to fly in time, the mission was moved to the rocket’s second launch. An artist’s rendering of the ESCAPADE mission patch.

Image: Michael Cain / Spaceflight Now Update Nov. 9, 3:50 a.m. EST (0850 UTC): SpaceX landed its booster on the drone ship. Update Nov. 8, 7:30 a.m. EST (1230 UTC): SpaceX scrubbed the launch due to poor booster recovery weather. Following a last minute scrub Saturday morning, SpaceX launched a batch of Starlink satellites in the predawn hours of Sunday morning. The launch came as the Federal Aviation Administration readies a rollout of commercial launch restrictions for U.S. airspace. The company said poor weather in the booster recovery zone caused them stand down from Saturday’s launch opportunity, but conditions were enough improved to support Sunday’s launch. The Starlink 10-51 mission lifted off on a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 3:10 a.m. EST (0810 UTC). The rocket flew on a north-easterly trajectory upon leaving Florida’s Space Coast. ﻿ The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 95 percent chance for favorable weather at liftoff on Sunday, citing a small chance for interference from cumulus clouds. “A low-pressure system will begin to develop over the Midwest and track to the northeast, dragging a cold front into the Florida panhandle on Sunday, with rounds of prefrontal showers starting as early as Saturday afternoon,” launch weather officers wrote. “For the launch window early Sunday morning, weather appears quiet ahead of the incoming front with only a distant chance of a Cumulus Cloud Rule violation, though winds at the recovery site are likely to be elevated due to a tightening pressure gradient on the east side of the Carolina low.” SpaceX launched the mission using the Falcon 9 booster with the tail number B1069, which made its 28th flight. Its previous missions included CRS-24, OneWeb Launch #15 and Eutelsat Hotbird 13F. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1069 performed an autonomous landing on the drone ship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas’, positioned in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina. This was the 131st booster landing on this vessel and the 531st booster landing to date. SpaceX intends to deploy the 29 Starlink V2 Mini Optimized satellites from the rocket’s upper stage a little more than an hour after liftoff.

In the face of the ongoing government shutdown, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who is also serving as NASA’s acting administrator, also issued a “temporary 10 percent reduction in flights at 40 high traffic airports across the country.” Among those impacted airports are Orlando International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, the two closest major airports to both Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg respectively. The launch curfew will have varying degrees of impact, depending on the interpretation of “commercial launch”. SpaceX announced five more Starlink missions between Nov. 10 and Nov. 19 and is also planning to launch the Transporter-15 mission on Nov. 11. Following a scrub Thursday night, United Launch Alliance’s next attempt to launch the ViaSat-3 F2 mission will also fall after the FAA’s launch restrictions go into effect. SpaceX does have some latitude with shuffling its launch times for its Starlink mission to fit the FAA’s new mandate. However, missions like Transporter-15 that seek to launch payloads into a Sun-synchronous orbit may need to seek special exemption. Spaceflight Now also reached out to the FAA for comment, but received the automated response: “Due to a lapse in funding, the FAA is not responding to routine media inquiries.” Rocket Lab for its part said that it shouldn’t face much impact from the decision. “We can confirm launches from [Launch Complex 1] in New Zealand are unaffected by the restrictions, as these launches do not operate in U.S. airspace,” the company said. “We also expect minimal impact to launches from LC-2 in Virginia.” A long-exposure shot of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket as it soars away from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center to begin the Starlink 10-51 mission on Nov. 9, 2025.

                "text": "A Falcon 9 rocket stands at pad 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base ahead of the planned launch of the Sentinel-6B mission. Image: SpaceX. The second spacecraft in a billion-dollar international mission to keep watch rising sea levels is scheduled to launch from California Sunday night, local time, weather permitting. The Sentinel-6B satellite will liftoff atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base at 9:21:42 p.m. PST (12:21:42 a.m. EST / 0521:42 UTC), almost exactly five years after its twin, the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from the same pad. Spaceflight Now will have live coverage starting about one hour prior to launch. Meteorologists with the U.S. Space Force’s Space Launch Delta 30, based at Vandenberg, said they were optimistic the weather would cooperate, despite a series of low pressure weather systems bringing heavy rainfall to the West Coast. The probability of a weather rule violation for Sunday’s launch attempt was put at 60 percent. “California has been one of the wettest places in the United States this weekend, even wetter than, say, the Midwest, which is really abnormal for Southern California,” Launch Weather Officer 1st Lt,. William F. Harbin told a pre-launch news conference Saturday. Weather conditions are forecast to improve on Monday, Harbin said, with the chance of breaking the weather rules falling to 40 percent in the event of a 24-hour delay. The Falcon 9 first stage, serial number B1097, is making its third flight. If everything goes as planned, B1097 will return to the launch site, landing approximately 1,400 feet west of the pad from which it took off. The mission will mark the 500th flight of a previously flown Falcon 9 booster. Artist’s impression of the Sentinel-6B spacecraft separating from the Falcon 9’s second stage. Image: ESA. The Sentinel-6B spacecraft, built by Airbus Defence and Space in Germany, will be deployed from the Falcon 9’s second stage 57 minutes into the flight after two burns by the Falcon 9’s second stage. Sentinel-6B and its predecessor are part of a $1 billion international collaboration to continue a decades-long effort to accurately measure sea heights from orbit. The costs of the project were split evenly between the United States and Europe. Partnering for the mission are NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (Eumetsat), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Commission and the French space agency CNES. From its circular orbit, 830 miles (1,336 km) high, inclined at 66 degrees to the Equator, Sentinel-6B will use cloud-penetrating radar to measure sea level heights down to roughly an inch across 90 percent of the world’s oceans. “This information lets us monitor significant ocean features like ocean currents, sea level and wave height, and gives us a view into the inner workings of the ocean,” said Karen St. Germain, NASA’s director of Earth science. “This information underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping, and these measurements form the basis for us, flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage, sites and other assets along our shoreline.” In line with Trump Administration policies, mission officials have made no mention of climate change, which scientists say is a major factor driving rising sea levels.",

Weather conditions are forecast to improve on Monday, Harbin said, with the chance of breaking the weather rules falling to 40 percent in the event of a 24-hour delay. The Falcon 9 first stage, serial number B1097, is making its third flight. If everything goes as planned, B1097 will return to the launch site, landing approximately 1,400 feet west of the pad from which it took off. The mission will mark the 500th flight of a previously flown Falcon 9 booster. Artist’s impression of the Sentinel-6B spacecraft separating from the Falcon 9’s second stage. Image: ESA. The Sentinel-6B spacecraft, built by Airbus Defence and Space in Germany, will be deployed from the Falcon 9’s second stage 57 minutes into the flight after two burns by the Falcon 9’s second stage. Sentinel-6B and its predecessor are part of a $1 billion international collaboration to continue a decades-long effort to accurately measure sea heights from orbit. The costs of the project were split evenly between the United States and Europe. Partnering for the mission are NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (Eumetsat), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Commission and the French space agency CNES. From its circular orbit, 830 miles (1,336 km) high, inclined at 66 degrees to the Equator, Sentinel-6B will use cloud-penetrating radar to measure sea level heights down to roughly an inch across 90 percent of the world’s oceans. “This information lets us monitor significant ocean features like ocean currents, sea level and wave height, and gives us a view into the inner workings of the ocean,” said Karen St. Germain, NASA’s director of Earth science. “This information underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping, and these measurements form the basis for us, flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage, sites and other assets along our shoreline.” In line with Trump Administration policies, mission officials have made no mention of climate change, which scientists say is a major factor driving rising sea levels.",

The Data and Reasoning Fabric project out of Ames Research Center tested delivery of programs and information to these kinds of vehicles. Credit: NASA One of the biggest goals for companies in the field of artificial intelligence is developing “agentic” or autonomous systems. These metaphorical agents can perform tasks without a guiding human hand. This parallels the goals of the emerging urban air mobility industry, which hopes to bring autonomous flying vehicles to cities around the world. One company got a head start on doing both with some help from NASA. Autonomy Association International Inc. (AAI) is a public benefit corporation based in Mountain View, California, near NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. In 2022, AAI signed a Space Act Agreement with Ames to support the agency’s Data and Reasoning Fabric project, which aimed to support the transportation of people and cargo to areas previously unserved or underserved by aviation, and to provide reliable, accurate, and current data for aeronautic decision-making. “Inspiration to lean into data fabric to solve certain complexities came from our NASA partnership,” said AAI cofounder and the project’s industry principal investigator Greg Deeds. “Working on this project was a great experience. Working with NASA engineers and leaders gave us experience that we’ll carry forward in all of our products.” Greg Deeds looks out the window of a helicopter flying over Arizona during a test of Autonomy Association International’s data fabric technology in collaboration with NASA. Through multiple evaluations above Phoenix, the testing proved the capabilities of the company’s Digital Infrastructure Platform. Credit: Autonomy Association International Inc. Similar to how clothing fabric is made of intertwined threads, a data fabric comprises intertwined data sources. While a data fabric built by a tech company may include data from a few different cloud service providers, NASA’s Data and Reasoning Fabric can also use information provided by local governments and other service providers. By viewing airspace as a large data fabric, an autonomous vehicle can take in data and requests from the cities and towns it flies over and prioritize responses between them. Working with Ken Freeman, principal investigator of the project at Ames, AAI and NASA performed four testing adaptations of the data fabric technology in the air over Arizona. Using hardware and software developed by AAI, the flights tested advanced air mobility passenger flights and the use of a drone for rapid delivery of medical supplies from urban to rural areas and back, while sending new tasks to the aircraft in flight. A helicopter stood in for the drone and air taxi, flying over towns, universities, tribal lands, and the airspace around Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and obtaining data and programs given to it from different places. “We’re focusing on the digital infrastructure building blocks of smart cities and regions of the future,” said Jennifer Deeds, chief operating officer and cofounder of AAI. In the years since the original NASA project, the company has cultivated relationships and customers abroad, including companies in agriculture, real estate development, and industrial food production using its system to aggregate and manage data. Released in 2024, the company’s Digital Infrastructure Platform uses the same technology originally designed for the NASA flight test. A new, “agentic” version followed not long after, able to retrieve necessary AI programs with minimal interaction. As AI unlocks innovation across American industries, NASA is equipping its commercial partners with the keys, using proven technology to generate breakthrough solutions.

                "text": "A Falcon 9 rocket launches Nov. 17, 2025, carrying the Sentinel-6B ocean monitoring satellite. Image: SpaceX. SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change. The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The follow-on spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST. Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds. The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data. That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity. But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to “climate change” or “global warming” in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday. In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a “need to know list” said the satellite would “provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth’s coastlines – and how fast this is happening.” In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA’s first “need to know” item said simply that “Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is … key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.” An artist’s impression of the Sentinel-6B satellite in orbit. Image: NASA. Karen St. Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels. “Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet’s sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,” she said. She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites “underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.” The data, she continued, will help scientists “understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.” Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch. After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site. The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft. Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world’s oceans. The Sentinel-6B is deployed from the upper stage of the Falcon 9. Image: SpaceX. Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite also will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites. But the primary mission is monitoring Earth’s changing sea levels. “The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,” Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020. “We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements … but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.” The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. St. Germain said NASA’s share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects. From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits. Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey. We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.",

Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects. From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits. Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey. We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.",

The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios.",

Future multi-modal frameworks should include weighting schemes reflecting bandwidth and central wavelength coverage.",

We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at $z\\gtrsim2.5$, the two processes act with comparable strength between $0.8\\lesssim z\\lesssim2.5$, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies ($M_\\star\\lesssim10^{10} M_\\odot$) at $z\\lesssim0.8$. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history.

We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\\lesssim1.2$. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at $z\\gtrsim2.5$, the two processes act with comparable strength between $0.8\\lesssim z\\lesssim2.5$, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies ($M_\\star\\lesssim10^{10} M_\\odot$) at $z\\lesssim0.8$. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history. COSMOS-Web, the largest JWST survey, provides accurate and deep photometric redshifts, reaching 80% mass completeness at $\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot)\\sim8.7$ at $z\\sim7$, enabling the first view of how environments shaped galaxy evolution from the epoch of reionization to the present day.",

To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~<~\\log(M_{\\star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot})~<~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$\\alpha$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\\simeq3$. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the H$\\alpha$-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.",

Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution.",

To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30 m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the \"CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy\" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\\sim$24 kpc.

To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30 m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the \"CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy\" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy.

One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift, radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at comparable spatial resolution.

In all three quasars, we found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low redshifts.
